\songtitle{The cause of Christ}
\begin{song}

The only thing I want in life \\
is to be known for loving Christ. \\
To build His church, to love His bride \\
and make His name known far and wide!

For this cause I live, for this cause I'd die, \\
I surrender all for the cause of Christ! \\
All I once held dear, I will leave behind, \\
for my joy is this, oh the cause of Christ!

He is all my soul will prize, \\
regardless of the joy or trial. \\
When agonizing questions rise, \\
in Jesus all my hope abides.

Bridge: \\
Jesus, my Jesus, \\
for Your glory, for Your name! \\
Jesus, my Jesus, \\
I will only sing Your praise! \\
Jesus, my Jesus …

It is not fame that I desire, \\
nor stature in my brother's eye. \\
I pray it's said about my life, \\
that I lived more \\
to build Your name than mine. \\
ort he cause of Christ.
