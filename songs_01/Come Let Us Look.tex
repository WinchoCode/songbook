\songtitle{Come Let Us Look}
\begin{song}

Come let us look towards our God, \\
come, rejoice in his light, \\
turn to the Lord, give praise to his name, \\
He is the Lord of all, \\
He is the Lord of all.

I called on the Lord and He answered me, \\
From all of my fears He set me free.

Lord, You are our strength, \\
a refuge all our days, \\
all your blessings are sure, \\
You guide us in your ways.

Come, trust in the Lord, \\
His name always praise, \\
taste, see He is good \\
and kind in all his ways.
\end{song}
