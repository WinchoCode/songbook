\songtitle{I Heard the Voice of Jesus Say}
\begin{song}

I heard the voice of Jesus say \\
“Come unto Me and rest; \\
lay down, o weary one, lay down \\
your head up on My breast.” \\
I came to Jesus as I was, \\
weary, and worn, and sad; \\
I found in Him a resting place, \\
and He has made me glad.

I heard a voice of Jesus say: \\
“Behold I freely give \\
the living water; thirsty one, \\
stoop down and drink, and live” \\
I came to Jesus, and I drank \\
of that life-giving stream; \\
my thirst was quenched, my soul revived, \\
and now I live in Him.

I heard the voice of Jesus say \\
“I am this dark world’s Light; \\
Look unto Me, your morn shall rise, \\
and all your day be bright” \\
I looked to Jesus, and I found \\
in Him my Star, my Sun; \\
and in that Light of life, I´ll walk \\
till traveling days are done.
