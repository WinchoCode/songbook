\songtitle{Candlelight carol}
\begin{song}

How do you capture the wind on the water? How do you count all the stars in the sky? How can you measure the love of a mother, Or how can you write down a baby's first cry?

Candlelight, angel light, firelight and star-glow Shine on his cradle till breaking of dawn. \\
Gloria, Gloria in excelsis Deo! \\
Angels are singing; the Christ child is born!

Shepherds and wise men will kneel and adore him, Seraphim round him their vigil will keep; \\
Nations proclaim him their Lord and their Saviour. But Mary will hold him and sing him to sleep.

Find him at Bethlehem laid in a manger. Christ our Redeemer asleep in the hay, Godhead incarnate and hope of salvation: \\
A child with his mother that first Christmas Day.
\end{song}
