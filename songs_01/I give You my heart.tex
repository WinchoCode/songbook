\songtitle{I give You my heart}
\begin{song}

This is my desire, to honor You. \\
Lord, with all my heart I worship You. All I have within me, I give You praise, All that I adore is in You.

Lord, I give You my heart, I give You my soul, \\
I live for You alone. Ev’ry breath that I take, Ev’ry moment I'm awake, \\
Lord, have your way in me.
\end{song}
