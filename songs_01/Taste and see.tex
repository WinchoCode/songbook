\songtitle{Taste and see}
\begin{song}

Taste and see, \\
taste and see the goodness of the Lord. O taste and see, \\
taste and see the goodness of the Lord, of the Lord.

I will bless the Lord at all times. \\
His praise shall always be on my lips; my soul shall glory in the Lord \\
for He has been so good to me.

Glorify the Lord with me. Together let us all praise his name. \\
I called the Lord and He answered me; from all my troubles He set me free.

Worship the Lord, all you people. You’ll want for nothing if you ask. Taste and see that God is good; \\
In Him we need put all our trust.
