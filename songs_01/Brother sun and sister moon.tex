\songtitle{Brother sun and sister moon}
\begin{song}

Brother sun, and sister moon \\
I seldom see you, seldom hear your tune. Preoccupied, with selfish misery.

Brother wind, and sister air, \\
open my eyes, to visions pure and fair. \\
That I may see, the glory around me.

I am God's creature, of him, I am part. \\
I feel his love, awakening my heart.

Brother sun, and sister moon, \\
I now do see you, I can hear your tune! \\
so much in love, with all that I survey.
\end{song}
