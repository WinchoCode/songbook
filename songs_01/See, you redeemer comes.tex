\songtitle{See, you redeemer comes}
\begin{song}

See, you redeemer comes, \\
comes with your salvation in hand. \\
He comes to save us all! \\
People of the Lord, shout for joy!

We whom the prophets long foretold, \\
he comes to free you from your chains. \\
He whom your heart has longed to know, \\
See, the Saviour comes!

It is our God, who comes on earth, \\
assuming mortal flesh like us. \\
He comes to bring us life anew, \\
see, the Saviour comes!

He promised us he would return \\
when he will reign forevermore, \\
when we shall see his glory clear, \\
see, the Saviour comes!
\end{song}
