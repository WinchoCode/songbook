\songtitle{In our darkness is risen a light}
\begin{song}

In our darkness is risen a light, \\
the new light of Crist has dawned. \\
It will shine for all eyes to see, \\
it will live in every heart.

Let the dessert blossom once more, \\
let it ring with songs of great joy, \\
for the spring and the fountains \\
bring new life to the barren land.

You shall see the glory of God, \\
and the majesty of the Lord, \\
say to all the faint hearts, \\
do not fear, our God has come to save.

He has come to bring us new life, \\
let our hearts receive him in joy, \\
For God loves us so much, \\
to ransom us from death.
\end{song}
