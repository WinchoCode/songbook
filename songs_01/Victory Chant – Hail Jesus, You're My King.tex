\songtitle{Victory Chant – Hail Jesus, You're My King}
\begin{song}

Hail Jesus! You're my King! \\
Your life frees me to sing. \\
I will praise You all of my days, \\
You're perfect in all Your ways!

Hail Jesus! You're my Lord! \\
I will obey Your word! \\
Because I want to see Your kingdom come, \\
not my will, but Yours be done.

Glory, glory to the Lamb! \\
You will take us into the land. \\
We will conquer in Your name \\
and proclaim that "Jesus reigns!"
\end{song}
