\songtitle{Seek ye first}
\begin{song}

Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, \\
And all these things shall be added unto you. Allelu, alleluia.

Ask, and it shall be given unto you. Seek, and ye shall find. \\
Knock, and it shall be opened unto you. Allelu, alleluia.

You do not live by bread alone, but by ev’ry word \\
That proceeds from the mouth of God. Allelu, alleluia.
\end{song}
