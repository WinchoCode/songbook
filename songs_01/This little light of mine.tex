\begin{song}

This little light of mine, \\
I’m gonna let it shine.	x3 Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.

Ev’rywhere I go, \\
I’m gonna let it shine.	x3 \\
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.

Jesus gave it to me; \\
I’m gonna let it shine.	x3 Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.
\end{song}
