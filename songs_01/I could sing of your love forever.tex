\songtitle{I could sing of your love forever}
\begin{song}

Over the mountains and the sea your river runs with love for me, \\
and I will open up my heart and let the Healer set me free. \\
I’m happy to be in the truth, and I will daily lift my hands, \\
for I will always sing of when your love came down, yeah.

I could sing of your love forever. (x4)

Oh, I feel like dancing; it’s foolishness I know. \\
But when the world has seen the light, \\
they will dance with joy like we’re dancing now.
\end{song}
