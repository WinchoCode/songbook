\songtitle{Return to God}
\begin{song}

Return to God with all your heart, the source of grace and mercy., \\
Come, seek the tender faithfulness of God.

Now the time of grace has come, the day of salvation. \\
Come and learn now the way of our God.

I will take your heart of stone, and place a heart within you; \\
a heart of compassion and love.
\end{song}
