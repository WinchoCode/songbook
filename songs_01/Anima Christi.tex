\songtitle{Anima Christi}
\begin{song}

Soul of Christ, sanctify me. Body of Christ, save me. \\
Water from the side of Christ, wash me. Passion of Christ, give me strength. \\
Hear me Jesus, hide me in thy wounds, that I may never leave thy side.

From all the evil that surrounds me, defend me \\
and when the call of death arrives, bid me come to Thee That I may praise Thee with thy saints forever.
\end{song}
