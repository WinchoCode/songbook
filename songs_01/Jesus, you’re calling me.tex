\songtitle{Jesus, you’re calling me}
\begin{song}

Jesus, you’re calling me. \\
Jesus, I come to you, you look at me with love, \\
your love transforms my life. \\
Jesus, I come to you!

Your holy word, my God, \\
is light upon my path; \\
I am your servant, Lord, \\
you are my hope and strength!

My worries, my concerns, \\
I give them all to you. \\
Good Shepherd of my soul, \\
oh I adore you, Lord!

O Lord, I am so poor, \\
and yet You care for me. \\
My Saviour, Lord, my God, \\
without you I am lost!
