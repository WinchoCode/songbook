\songtitle{O love that will not let me go}
\begin{song}

O Love that will not let me go, I rest my weary soul in Thee. \\
I give Thee back the life I owe \\
that in Thine oceans depths its flow may richer, fuller be

O Light that follows all my way \\
I yield my flickering torch to Thee My heart restores its borrowed ray that in Thy sunshine's blaze its day may brighter, fairer be

O Joy that seekest me through pain I cannot close my heart to Thee \\
I trace the rainbow through the rain and feel the promise is not vain: \\
that morn shall tearless be

O Cross that liftest up my head I dare not ask to fly from Thee I lay in dust life's glory dead \\
and from the ground there blossoms red life that shall endless be
\end{song}
