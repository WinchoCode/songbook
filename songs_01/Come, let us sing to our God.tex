\begin{song}

Come, let us sing to our God, \\
the king of all heaven, \\
He has come to save the humanity \\
and to give us life. \\
O sing to God, your King, Jerusalem, \\
and dance for joy!

He came to save us sinners from our sins, \\
o sing, Jerusalem, and dance for joy! \\
Yes, by his death we’re freed from all our sins, o sing, Jerusalem, and dance for joy!

Let us reject our sin and turn to Him, \\
o sing, Jerusalem, and dance for joy! \\
For we are pardoned by his tender love, \\
o sing, Jerusalem, and dance for joy!

The king of glory shines his light on us, \\
o sing, Jerusalem, and dance for joy! \\
Now we can see his glory dwelling here, \\
o sing, Jerusalem, and dance for joy!

He has not come to judge us for our sins, \\
o sing, Jerusalem, and dance for joy! \\
He comes to lead us to the Father’s house, \\
o sing, Jerusalem, and dance for joy!

If we believe, He’ll heal us of our wounds, \\
o sing, Jerusalem, and dance for joy! \\
Yes, we believe, He is the bread of life, \\
o sing, Jerusalem, and dance for joy!

Jesus, our God, Emmanuel is here, \\
o sing, Jerusalem, and dance for joy! \\
Yes, by his Spirit He is in our midst, \\
o sing, Jerusalem, and dance for joy!
