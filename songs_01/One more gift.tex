\songtitle{One more gift}
\begin{song}

One bread, one body, one Lord of all one cup of blessing which we bless \\
And we, though many, throughout the earth we are one body in this one Lord.

If there's one more gift I'd ask of You, Lord it would be peace here on earth \\
As gentle as Your children's laughter all around, all around

Your people have grown weary of living in confusion \\
When will we realize \\
that neither heaven is at peace when we will live not in peace

Grant me serenity within for the confusions around \\
are mere reflections of what's within ... what's within in me
\end{song}
