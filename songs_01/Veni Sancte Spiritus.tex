\songtitle{Veni Sancte Spiritus}
\begin{song}

Come, Holy Spirit, from heaven shine forth \\
with your glorious light. \\
Veni Sancte Spiritus.

Come, Father of the poor, come, \\
generous Spirit, come, light of our hearts. \\
Veni Sancte Spiritus.

Come from the four winds, O Spirit, come \\
breath of God; disperse the shadows over us, renew and strengthen your people. \\
Veni Sancte Spiritus.

Most kindly warming light! \\
Enter the inmost depths of our hearts, \\
for we are faithful to you. \\
Without your presence we have nothing worthy, nothing pure. \\
Veni Sancte Spiritus.

You are only comforter, Peace of the soul. \\
In the heat you shade us; \\
in our labor you refresh us, \\
and in trouble you are our strength. \\
Veni Sancte Spiritus.

On all who put their trust in you \\
and receive you in faith, shower all your gifts. Grant that they may grow in you \\
and persevere to the end. Give them lasting joy! \\
Veni Sancte Spiritus.
