\songtitle{Lay your hands}
\begin{song}

Lay your hands gently upon us. Let their touch render your peace. \\
Let them bring your forgiveness and healing. Lay your hands gently, lay your hands.

You were sent to free the broken hearted. You were sent to give sight to the blind. You desire to heal all our illnesses. \\
Lay your hands gently, lay your hands.

Lord we come to You through one another. Lord we come to You in our need.

Lord we come to You seeking wholeness. Lay your hands gently, lay your hands.
\end{song}
