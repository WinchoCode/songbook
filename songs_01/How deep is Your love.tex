\songtitle{How deep is Your love}
\begin{song}

You were broken that I might be healed You were cast off that I might draw near You were thirsty that I might come drink Cried out in anguish that I might sing:

How deep is your love \\
How high and how wide is your mercy How deep is your grace \\
Our hearts overflow with praise to You

You knew darkness that I might know light Wept great tears that mine might be dried Stripped of glory that I might be clothed Crushed by Your Father to call me your own.
\end{song}
