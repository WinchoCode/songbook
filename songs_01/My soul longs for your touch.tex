\songtitle{My soul longs for your touch}
\begin{song}

My soul longs for your touch, \\
living God, most high. \\
Take me, take my fears, o Lord, my king. \\
For you are all my joy, o come to me!

Jesus, Lord, gentle and humble.

Jesus, Lord, gentle and humble of heart, \\
mould my heart to be like yours. 2x

Oooooh, in you I put my trust, O Lord!
\end{song}
