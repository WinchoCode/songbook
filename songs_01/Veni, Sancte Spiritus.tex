\begin{song}

Veni, Sancte Spiritus! 4x

Come, O Holy Spirit, \\
give us light and give us life. \\
Dwell in us and be our guide. \\
Fill our hearts, fulfill our lives, \\
enlighten us in truth. \\
Come and touch us with your fire!

Fill us with your grace, \\
renew us with your healing touch. \\
We are helpless without You. \\
Set us free from doubt and darkness, \\
wash our sins away, \\
come and touch us with your fire!

Bring us to the Father, \\
let Him guard us with his peace. \\
Come, reveal to us the Son. \\
Pour upon your Church the gifts \\
which You alone can give: \\
come and touch us with your fire!
