\songtitle{Though the mountains may fall}
\begin{song}

Though the mountains may fall and the hills turn to dust, \\
yet the love of the Lord will stand \\
as a shelter for all who will call on His name. Sing the praise and the glory of God.

Could the Lord ever leave you? Could the Lord forget His love? Though a mother forsake her child, He will not abandon you.

Should you turn and forsake Him, He will gently call your name. \\
Should you wander away from Him, He will always take you back.

Go to Him when you're weary, He will give you eagle's wings. You will run, never tire, \\
For your God will be your strength.
\end{song}
