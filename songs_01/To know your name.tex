\songtitle{To know your name}
\begin{song}

The precious blood of Jesus Christ redeems, \\
forgiven I’m alive, restored, set free. \\
Your majesty resides inside of me, \\
forever I believe, forever I believe.

Arrested by Your truth and righteousness, \\
Your grace has overwhelmed my brokenness. \\
Convicted by Your Spirit, led by Your Word, \\
Your love will never fail, \\
Your love will never fail!

I know You gave the world Your only son for us \\
to know Your name, \\
to live within the Savior's love. \\
He took my place knowing He'd be crucified, \\
and You loved, \\
You loved a people undeserving.
\end{song}
