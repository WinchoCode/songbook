\songtitle{I lift my eyes}
\begin{song}

I lifte my eyes to the mountains, \\
where will my help come from? \\
My help comes from th Lord, \\
who made heaven and earth! \\
My help comes from the Lord, \\
who made heaven and earth!

He will not let you fall, \\
the protector is awake, \\
the protecter of Israel \\
never slumber or sleeps.

He the Lord will guard your life, \\
by your side procteing you, \\
the sun won't strike you down by day, \\
or moon at night.

He will guard you from all harm, \\
He will guard you, keep you safe, \\
in your levaing and your coming back, \\
now and for always.
