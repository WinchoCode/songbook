\songtitle{Yes, I shall arise}
\begin{song}

Yes I shall arise \\
and return to my Father!

To You, O Lord, I lift up my soul \\
In You O my God, I place all my trust

Look down on me, have mercy O Lord Forgive me my sins behold all my grief.

My heart and soul shall yearn for your face Be gracious to me and answer my plea

Do not withhold your goodness from me Lord may your love be deep in my soul To You I pray have pity on me \\
My God, I have sinned against your great love

Mercy I cry, O Lord wash me clean and whiter than snow my spirit shall be

Give me again the joy of your help \\
Now open my lips your praise I will sing

Happy is he forgiven by God \\
His sins blotted out his guilt is no more

You are my joy my refuge and strength \\
Let all upright hearts give praise to the Lord

My soul will sing my heart will rejoice The blessings of God will fill all my days
\end{song}
