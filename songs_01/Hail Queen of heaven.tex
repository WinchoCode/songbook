\songtitle{Hail Queen of heaven}
\begin{song}

Hail queen of heaven, you are beyond compare Mary, full of grace enrobed with the sun crowned with the stars, the moon is at your feet \\
For our salvation’s dawn we have received in you

Mother Mary, new eve you’re the joy of your Lord You gave birth to our God our saviour Jesus Christ You have opened to us all we lost through our sin \\
Guide us all on our way O bright star of the morn

Mary, you still believed at the foot of the cross Keep us firm in our hope protect our faith in Him From the side of your son you have drawn for us all Streams of light and of grace poured out for all the world

O, the great joy of Eve when you were lifted up higher than all the angels ev’n higher than the clouds Mother Mary our queen O, how great is your joy Contemplating in you the promise of God’s life.

O, immaculate queen virgin free from all sin with your body and soul you entered into heav’n You were carried in glory \\
queen of heaven you’re blessed \\
You will welcome us all the day when we see God
\end{song}
