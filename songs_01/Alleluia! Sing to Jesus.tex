\songtitle{Alleluia! Sing to Jesus}
\begin{song}

Alleluia! Sing to Jesus! \\
His the scepter, his the throne. Alleluia! His the triumph, \\
his the victory alone; \\
Hark! The songs of peaceful Zion thunder like a mighty flood; \\
Jesus out of every nation \\
has redeemed us by his blood.

Alleluia! Not as orphans are we left in sorrow now; Alleluia! He is near us, \\
faith believes, nor questions how: \\
Though the clouds from sight received him when the forty days were o’er, \\
shall our hearts forget his promise, "I am with you evermore"?

Alleluia! King Eternal, \\
You the Lord of lords we own. Alleluia! Son of Mary, \\
Son of God from heaven’s throne. Our salvation You accomplished, robed in flesh, our new High Priest; here on earth both priest and victim in the Eucharistic feast.
