\songtitle{I Surrender}
\begin{song}

Here I am \\
down on my knees again, surrendering all, surrendering all.

And find me here \\
Lord, as You draw me near desperate for You, Desperate for You.

I surrender.

Drench my soul \\
as mercy and grace unfold. I hunger and thirst, \\
I hunger and thirst.

With arms stretched wide I know You hear my cry. Speak to me now, \\
speak to me now.

I surrender, I surrender. \\
I wanna know You more, I wanna know You more.

Like a rushing wind, Jesus breathe within. Lord have Your way, \\
Lord have Your way in me.

Like a mighty storm stir within my soul. Lord have Your way, \\
Lord have Your way in me.

Lord have Your way, \\
Lord have Your way in me.
\end{song}
