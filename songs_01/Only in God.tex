\songtitle{Only in God}
\begin{song}

Only in God is my soul at rest, In Him comes my salvation. \\
He only is my rock, \\
My strength and my salvation. My stronghold, my Savior, I shall not be afraid at all. My stronghold, my Savior, I shall not be moved. \\
Only in God is found safety When my enemy pursues me. Only in God is found glory \\
When I am found meek and found lowly.

Only in God is my soul at rest, In Him comes my salvation.

100	Open the eyes of my heart, Lord

Open the eyes of my heart, Lord Open the eyes of my heart \\
I want to see You, I want to see You (repeat)

To see You high and lifted up Shinin' in the light of your glory Pour out your power and love as we sing holy, holy, holy

Holy, holy, holy \\
We cry holy, holy, holy You are holy, holy, holy \\
I want to see You (repeat)
