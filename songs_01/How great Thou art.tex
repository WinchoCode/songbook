\songtitle{How great Thou art}
\begin{song}

O Lord My God, when I in awesome wonder Consider all the works Thy hands have made I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder \\
Thy power throughout the universe displayed

Then sings my soul \\
my Savior God, to Thee

how great Thou art \\
how great Thou art	(repeat)

When through the woods and forest glades I wander and hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees \\
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur and hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze

And when I think that God, His Son not sparing Sent Him to die I scarce can take it in \\
That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing, He bled and died to take away my sin.

When Christ shall come with shouts of acclamation And take me home what joy shall fill my heart Then I shall bow in humble adoration \\
and there proclaim my God, how great Thou art.
\end{song}
