\songtitle{Be Thou my vision}
\begin{song}

Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart; Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art: Thou my best thought, by day or by night, Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

Be Thou my wisdom, and Thou my true word; I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord: Thou my great Father, I Thy true son; \\
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

Riches I heed not, or man’s empty praise, Thou mine inheritance, now and always:

Thou and Thou only, first in my heart, High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.

High King of heaven, my victory won, \\
May I reach Heaven’s joys, O bright Heav’n’s Sun! Heart of my own heart, whatever befall, \\
Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.
\end{song}
