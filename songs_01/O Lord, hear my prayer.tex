\songtitle{O Lord, hear my prayer}
\begin{song}

O Lord, hear my prayer, \\
O Lord, hear my prayer; \\
when I call, answer me. \\
O Lord, hear my prayer, \\
O Lord, hear my prayer; \\
come and listen to me.

The Lord is my song, \\
the Lord is my praise, \\
all my hope comes from God. \\
The Lord is my song, \\
the Lord is my praise, \\
God, the wellspring of life.
