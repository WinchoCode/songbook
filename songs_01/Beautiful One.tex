\songtitle{Beautiful One}
\begin{song}

Wonderful, so wonderful \\
is Your unfailing love. \\
Your cross has spoken mercy over me. \\
No eye has seen, no ear has heard, \\
no heart could fully know \\
how glorious, how beautiful You are!

Beautiful One I love, \\
You're beautiful One I adore, \\
Beautiful One, my soul must sing!

Powerful, so powerful \\
Your glory fills the skies. \\
Your mighty works displayed for all to see. \\
The beauty of Your majesty \\
awakes my heart to see \\
how marvellous, how wonderful You are!

You opened my eyes to Your wonders anew, \\
You captured my heart with this love. \\
'Cause nothing on earth is as beautiful as You.
