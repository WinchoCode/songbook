\songtitle{With all I am}
\begin{song}

Into Your hand I commit again \\
with all I am for You, Lord. \\
You hold my world in the palm of Your hand \\
and I'm Yours, forever.

Jesus, I believe in You! \\
Jesus, I belong to You! \\
You're the reason that I live, \\
the reason that I sing (with all I am).

I'll walk with You wherever You go, \\
through tears and joy I'll trust in You. \\
And I will live in all of Your ways, \\
your promises, forever.

I will worship, I will worship You …
\end{song}
