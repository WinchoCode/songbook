\songtitle{Come, Holy Spirit, come}
\begin{song}

Come, Holy Spirit, \\
come and set our world on fire! \\
Come, Holy Spirit, come set us ablaze!

Fill us with your love, renew in us the faith, \\
and come and set our hearts on fire!

Guide us in the truth, reveal to us the Son, \\
and come and set our hearts on fire!

Fill us with your strength, \\
and send us in the world, \\
and come and set our hearts on fire!

Power from above, come help us to be free, \\
to tell that Jesus is the Lord!
