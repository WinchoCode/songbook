\songtitle{As I Kneel Before You}
\begin{song}

As I kneel before you \\
As I bow my head in prayer Take this day, make it yours and fill me with your love

Ave Maria, gratia plena Dominus tecum, benedicta tu

All I have I give you \\
Every dream and wish are yours Mother of Christ, mother of mine, present them to my Lord
\end{song}
