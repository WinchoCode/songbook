\songtitle{King of Love}
\begin{song}

The King of Love my Shepherd is Whose goodness faileth never. \\
I nothing lack if I am His And He is mine forever, And He is mine forever.

Where streams of living water flow My ransomed soul He leadeth, \\
And where the verdant pastures grow With food celestial feedeth.

Never failing, Ruler of my heart. Everlasting, Lover of my soul. \\
On the mountain high or in the valley low, The King of Love my Shepherd is, \\
The King of Love my Shepherd is.

Lost and foolish, off I strayed But, yet in love, He sought me. And on His shoulder gently laid And home rejoicing brought me.

In death’s dark veil I fear no ill With Thee, dear Lord, beside me. Thy rod and staff my comfort still Thy cross before to guide me. \\
Oh, Hallelujah, Hallelujah. Oh, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.

So through all the length of days Thy goodness faileth never. \\
Good Shepherd, may I sing your praise Within your house forever, \\
Within your house forever.
