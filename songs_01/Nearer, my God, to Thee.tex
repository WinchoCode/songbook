\songtitle{Nearer, my God, to Thee}
\begin{song}

Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee! E'en though it be a cross that raiseth me; \\
Still all my song shall be nearer, my God, to Thee,

Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!

Though like the wanderer, the sun gone down, Darkness be over me, my rest a stone; \\
Yet in my dreams I'd be nearer, my God, to Thee,

There let the way appear steps unto heav'n; All that Thou sendest me in mercy giv'n; Angels to beckon me nearer, my God, to Thee,

Then with my waking thoughts bright with Thy praise, Out of my stony griefs Bethel I'll raise; \\
So by my woes to be nearer, my God, to Thee,

Or if on joyful wing, cleaving the sky, \\
Sun, moon, and stars forgot, upwards I’ll fly, \\
Still all my song shall be, nearer, my God, to Thee,
\end{song}
