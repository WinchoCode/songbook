\songtitle{Come, Holy Spirit, comforter!}
\begin{song}

Come, Holy Spirit, comforter of our souls. Come, Holy Spirit, urge us on, urge us on!

Come, bring your light, reveal the truth, \\
pour out your healing love. \\
Increase our faith, renew our joy, \\
give strength from above, \\
and come, Holy Spirit, come. \\
And come, Holy Spirit, come.

Come, Holy Spirit, promised guide of our souls. Come, Holy Spirit, show the way, show the way!

Come, Holy Spirit, love poured in our hearts. Come, Holy Spirit, mould our hearts, \\
mould our hearts!
\end{song}
