\songtitle{Table of plenty}
\begin{song}

Come to the feast of heaven and earth! Come to the table of plenty! \\
God will provide for all that we need here at the table of plenty

O come and sit at my table \\
where saints and sinners are friends I wait to welcome the lost and lonely to share the cup of my love

O come and eat without money Come to drink without price My feast of gladness will feed \\
your spirit with faith and fullness of life.

My bread will ever sustain you through days of sorrow and woe My wine will flow like a sea \\
of gladness to flood the depths of your soul

Your fields will flower in fullness your homes will flourish in peace For I, the giver of home \\
and harvest will send my rain on the soil
\end{song}
