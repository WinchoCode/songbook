\songtitle{Come as we journey}
\begin{song}

Trav'ling on life's daily journey, \\
we never walk alone. \\
Mary, our Mother, is with us, \\
sharing our pilgrim road.

Come as we journey along our way, \\
Santa Maria, come! 2x

Though some will tell us, discouraged, "Nothing can ever change," \\
fight for a new world of justice; \\
fight till the truth is gained.

While people aimlessly wander, \\
Mary is at their side. \\
She lends her hand to her children, \\
those who in love abide.

Though many steps on the journey \\
seem to be made in vain, \\
still we are forging a pathway \\
others will walk one day!
\end{song}
