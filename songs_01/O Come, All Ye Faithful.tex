\songtitle{O Come, All Ye Faithful}
\begin{song}

O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem \\
Come and behold Him, born the King of Angels

O come, let us adore Him (x3) Christ the Lord

O sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation Sing all that hear in heaven God's holy word Give to our Father glory in the Highest

All Hail! Lord, we greet Thee, born this happy morning O Jesus! For evermore be Thy name adored \\
Word of the Father now in flesh appearing
\end{song}
