\songtitle{Lift up your heads, behold the one true light}
\begin{song}

Lift up your heads, behold the one true light. \\
Here is the Christ, here is the Prince of Peace. \\
Lift up your hearts, receive the gift of mercy. \\
Our Saviour comes, our Saviour dwells with us.

Jesus Christ, the Son of God made Man \\
among his own comes to make a home. \\
Come and see, behold Emmmanuel, \\
He is with us, the Word of God made flesh.

Come o Lord! Your temple is made ready. \\
Your word is food, our hearts will take their fill. \\
Speak, O Lord! Your servants come to hear, \\
Your children, Lord, your children, \\
Lord, are we!
\end{song}
