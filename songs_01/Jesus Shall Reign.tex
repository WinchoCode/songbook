\songtitle{Jesus Shall Reign}
\begin{song}

Jesus shall reign where’er the sun \\
does its successive journeys run; \\
His Kingdom spread from shore to shore, \\
till moons shall wax and wane no more.

To Him shall endless pray’r be made. \\
And endless praises crown His head, \\
His name like sweet perfume shall rise \\
with ev’ry morning sacrifice.

People and realms of every tongue \\
dwell on His love with sweetest song; \\
and infant voices shall proclaim \\
their earthly blessings on His name.

Blessings abound where’er He reigns: \\
the pris’ners leap to lose their chains, \\
the weary find eternal rest, \\
and all who suffer want are blessed.

Let every creature rise and bring \\
their grateful honors to our King; \\
angels descend with songs again, \\
and earth repeat the loud Amen.

(He shall reign in glory, \\
crowned with grace and might, \\
bless His name and praise our sovereign King! \\
He shall reign forever with His chosen Bride \\
and all the Earth shall sing \\
that Jesus is the King!)
\end{song}
