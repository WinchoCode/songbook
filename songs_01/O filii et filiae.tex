\songtitle{O filii et filiae}
\begin{song}

Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

O sons and daughters of the King, \\
whom heavenly hosts in glory sing, \\
today the grave has lost its sting. \\
Alleluia!

That Easter morn at break of day, \\
the faithful women went their way \\
to seek the tomb where Jesus lay. \\
Alleluia!

An angel clad in white they see, \\
who sat and spoke unto the three, \\
"Your Lord has gone to Galilee." \\
Alleluia!

At night the apostles met in fear; \\
among them came their Master dear \\
and said, "My peace be with you here." \\
Alleluia!

When Thomas first the tidings heard \\
that some had seen the risen Lord, \\
he doubted the disciples' word. \\
Alleluia!

"My pierced side, O Thomas, see, \\
my hands, my feet I show to thee; \\
not faithless but believing be." \\
Alleluia!

No longer Thomas then denied; \\
he saw the feet, the hands, the side. \\
"You are my Lord and God!" he cried. \\
Alleluia!

How blest are they who have not seen \\
and yet whose faith has constant been, \\
for they eternal life shall win. \\
Alleluia!
