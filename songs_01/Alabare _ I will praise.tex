\songtitle{Alabare / I will praise}
\begin{song}

Alabare, alabare, alabare A Mi Senor / \\
I’ll Praise My Lord, I’ll Praise My Lord, \\
I’ll Praise My Lord for Ever More!

John saw the number of all those redeemed, \\
and all were singing praises to the Lord. \\
Thousands were praying, \\
ten thousands rejoicing \\
and all were singing praises to the Lord.

There’s no God as great as You, o Lord! \\
There is none, there is none! 2x

There’s no God who does the mighty wonders, \\
that the Lord, our God,  has done! 2x

Not with an army, nor with their weapons, \\
but by the Holy Spirit’s Power! 2x

And even mountains shall be moved [3x] \\
by the Holy Spirit’s power.

And also (Denmark) shall be saved [3] \\
by the Holy Spirit’s Power.
\end{song}
