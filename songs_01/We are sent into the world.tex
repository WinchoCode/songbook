\songtitle{We are sent into the world}
\begin{song}

We are sent into the world to proclaim the reign of God \\
We give glory to the risen Christ among us Though our eyes have not seen His face we believe \\
and we spread the story of our faith

Sent out to the world as the followers of Christ we are called to proclaim good news \\
For Christ conquered death in His rising to new life: rejoice in the power of the truth

Sent out to the world as disciples of the Word let us preach to the ends of the earth \\
For Christ conquered death in His rising to new life: rejoice in the promise of new birth

Sent out to the world as ambassadors of Christ, we are sent to all nations great and small \\
For Christ conquered death in His rising to new life: rejoice in the splendour of our call
\end{song}
