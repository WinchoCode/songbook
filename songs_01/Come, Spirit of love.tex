\songtitle{Come, Spirit of love}
\begin{song}

Come, Spirit of love, enflame our coldness. \\
Come, kindle your fire, within our hearts.

Come, Spirit of light, touch our souls, strengthen every heart in time of need.

Pour on all our wounds, healing love; \\
soften our hard hearts with gentle joy.

Though we go away, guide our steps; \\
rebuild all our hopes faith renew.
\end{song}
