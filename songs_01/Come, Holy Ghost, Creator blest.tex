\songtitle{Come, Holy Ghost, Creator blest}
\begin{song}

Come, Holy Ghost, Creator blest, \\
and in our hearts take up thy rest; \\
come with thy grace and heav’nly aid \\
to fill the hearts which thou hast made, \\
to fill the hearts which thou hast made.

O Comforter, to thee we cry, \\
thou heav’nly gift of God most high; \\
thou font of life and fire of love, \\
and sweet anointing from above, \\
and sweet anointing from above.

O Holy Ghost, trough thee alone, \\
know we the Father and the Son: \\
be this our never chaning creed, \\
that thou dost from them both proceed, \\
that thou dost from them both proceed,

Praised be to thee, Father and Son \\
and Holy Spirit, with them one; \\
and may the Son on us bestow \\
the gifts that from the Spirit flow, \\
the gifts that from the Spirit flow.
\end{song}
