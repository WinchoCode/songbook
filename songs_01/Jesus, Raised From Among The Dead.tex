\songtitle{Jesus, Raised From Among The Dead}
\begin{song}

Jesus, raised from among the dead, \\
all the word sings glory to you; \\
Jesus, raised from among the dead, \\
all the world cries out Alleluia!

Easter morning came, in the silence of dawn, \\
when our hope had gone, \\
when our hearts were forlorn; \\
Christ is risen, rejoice!

Let the earth rejoice, let the universe dance, \\
death is conquered now, let salvation advance. \\
Christ is risen, rejoice!

Loving till the end, you accepted the cross, \\
but then from the tomb life is given to us, \\
Chist is risen, Rejoice!

Sing a new song, sing his praises above, \\
we are saved from death, by the power of His love. \\
Christ is risen, rejoice!

Let us all exult, let the countryside sing; \\
All creation, come to give praise to your King, \\
Christ is risen, rejoice!
\end{song}
