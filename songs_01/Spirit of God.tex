\songtitle{Spirit of God}
\begin{song}

Spirit of God, breath of our life, \\
Spirit of God, fill us with fire. \\
Spirit of God, comfort our souls. \\
Come, make us whole!

Spirit, come and visit us, \\
Spirit, come and fill our hearts. \\
Spirit, come and give us life, \\
come, we long for you!

Come, o holiness of God, \\
come, anoint us with your love, \\
come and fill us with your truth, \\
come, we long for you!

Spirit, come and make us one, \\
Spirit, come and make us yours, \\
Spirit, come and make us new, \\
come, we long for you!
