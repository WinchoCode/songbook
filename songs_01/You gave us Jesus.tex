\songtitle{You gave us Jesus}
\begin{song}

You gave us Jesus who gave all for us. \\
He is our Saviour, true man and true God. \\
Queen of the world, gate of heaven for us. Mother Mary, we call to you.

Out of love, the Father chose you, \\
Mary most blessed. \\
In his love he dances for you, you are his joy!

You received the angel of God, \\
with joyful awe, \\
through your “yes”, God’s plan was fulfilled, Mother of Christ.

You received the spirit of life, virgin most pure, \\
You gave us our Lord Jesus Christ, \\
Mary, new Eve!

At the cross to us you were giv’n, \\
Mother of faith. \\
Help us love our Lord Jesus Christ, \\
now and always!

You received your heavenly crown, \\
body and soul. \\
You became the Queen of us all, \\
Mother of God.
