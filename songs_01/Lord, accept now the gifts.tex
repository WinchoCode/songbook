\songtitle{Lord, accept now the gifts}
\begin{song}

Lord, accept now the gifts that we offer, \\
to Your altar we bring bread and wine. \\
In this mystery they are our salvation, \\
body and blood of Your Son.

Now we offer our lives for your glory \\
in the off’ring of Jesus, Your Son. \\
Come, transform us for love and self giving, \\
make us a mirror of You!
\end{song}
