\songtitle{You are the voice}
\begin{song}

You are the voice of the living God, Calling us now to live in your love, To be children of God once again!

Praise for the light that shines through the night, from darkness to light, from death to new life, \\
and praise to the morning that brings forth the sun, to open our eyes to the Lord! \\
To open our eyes to the Lord! For…

Praise for the water that springs from the sea, the seed that gives life to all who believe, \\
God’s love overflowing, our hearts know the joy to be daughters and sons of the Lord! \\
To be daughters and sons of the Lord! For…

Praise for the singing and praise for the dance, with new heart and voice, \\
all raise the song of praise to creation; \\
all heaven and earth, come sing of the glory of God! Come sing of the glory of God! For…
