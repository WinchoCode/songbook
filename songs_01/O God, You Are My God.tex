\songtitle{O God, You Are My God}
\begin{song}

O God, You are my God, I long for You, \\
my soul thirsts for You \\
like a dry land without water. \\
O God, You are my God, I long for You, \\
in the sanctuary I am looking for Your glory.

For your love, o Lord, is better than life, \\
my lips will sing your praise! (x2)

So I will bless You all my life, \\
in your name I will lift up my hands. \\
My soul shall be filled as with a banquet, \\
my mouth shall praise You with joy!

On my bed I will remember You, my help, \\
in the shadow of your wings I rejoice. \\
My soul clings to You, my Lord and Saviour, \\
Your right hand holds me fast!
\end{song}
