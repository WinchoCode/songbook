\songtitle{Thy Word}
\begin{song}

Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path. (x2)

When I feel afraid, and I think I’ve lost my way, still You’re there right beside me. \\
Nothing will I fear \\
as long as You are near. Please be near me to the end.

I will not forget your love for me, and yet my heart forever is wandering. \\
Jesus, be my guide, \\
and hold me to your side. I will love You to the end.
\end{song}
