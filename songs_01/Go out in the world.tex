\begin{song}

Go out in the world, gotta go out in the world, \\
go out in the world, \\
tell ev'ryone the good news! \\
Go out in the world, gotta go out in the world, \\
go out in the world, \\
tell ev'ryone the good, good news!

Go and make disciples of all the nations, \\
go out in the world, \\
tell ev'ryone the good news! \\
Go and make disciples of all his people, \\
Go out in the world, \\
tell ev'ryone the good news!

See, the Lord is faithful to all his people! \\
Go out in the world, \\
tell ev'ryone the good news! \\
See, the Lord is faithful, he loves his people! \\
Go out in the world, \\
tell ev'ryone the good news!
