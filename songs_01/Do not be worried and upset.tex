\songtitle{Do not be worried and upset}
\begin{song}

Do not be worried and upset. Believe in God, believe also in me, \\
There are many rooms in my Father’s house, And I’m going to prepare a place, \\
Prepare a place for you.

I am the way, the truth and the life; \\
No one goes to the Father except by me. I am the way, the truth and the life, \\
And I’m going to prepare a place, Prepare a place for you. \\
After I go and prepare a place for you, \\
I will come back and take you to myself, So that you may come and be where I am. And I’m going to prepare a place, \\
Prepare a place for you.
\end{song}
