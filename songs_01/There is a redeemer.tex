\songtitle{There is a redeemer}
\begin{song}

There is a Redeemer: Jesus, God's own Son; precious Lamb of God, Messiah, \\
Holy One.

Thank You, O my Father, for giving us your Son, and leaving your Spirit \\
till the work on earth is done.

Jesus, my Redeemer, name above all names; precious Lamb of God, Messiah, \\
o for sinners slain.

When I stand in glory, I will see His face. \\
There I'll serve my King forever in that holy place.
\end{song}
