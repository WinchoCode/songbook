\songtitle{Come Holy Spirit Set us Free}
\begin{song}

Come Holy Spirit set us free; Come Holy Spirit let us see; Come Holy Spirit, ever be here deep in our hearts.

You who proceed \\
from the Father and the Son, O Spirit of all truth, \\
Instruct our minds. \\
Spirit of love, set our hearts on fire!

Water of life, \\
come to heal every wound, O breath of God on high, Give us your peace. \\
Fire of love, burn our sin away!

Spirit of peace,

cleanse our hearts of all grief;

Awake from your slumber! Arise from your sleep! \\
A new day is dawning for all those who weep. The people in darkness have seen a great light. The Lord of our longing has conquered the night. \\
Let us build the city of God. \\
May our tears be turned into dancing! For the Lord, our light and our love, has turned the night into day! \\
We are sons of the morning; we are daughters of day. \\
The One who has loved us has brightened our way. \\
The Lord of all kindness has called us to be \\
a light for his people to set their hearts free.

O Spirit of all joy come sing in us. Spirit of Life, give your life divine!
