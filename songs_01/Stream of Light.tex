\songtitle{Stream of Light}
\begin{song}

Stream of light immortal come enlighten me \\
Come Restorer of my joys give me life again \\
You alone I long for long to see Your face Jesus Christ my Saviour Redeemer, my Lord!

Purifying fire burn my sin away \\
Change my heart to love like Yours in humility Set my soul aflame \\
alight with Your own love Jesus Christ my Saviour Redeemer, my Lord!

Pardon all my sins Lord healing all my wounds Take my offering of love

little though it be

Speak, Lord, I’m listening. \\
Plant your word down deep in me. Speak, Lord, I’m listening. \\
Please show me the way. \\
Sometimes my heart is slow to follow You; Teach me to hear and understand; \\
And I’m told the things You promise; And I hope they all come true; \\
And I know what waits for those who wait; And put their trust in You. \\
Sometimes I stumble on my way to You; Stretch out again, your healing hand; And I’m told the things You promise;

In Your gentle mercy all me with your peace Jesus Christ my Saviour Redeemer, my Lord!

Let me seek Your Word Lord let me hear your voice \\
May I learn Your will for me Let my faith increase \\
Teach me in Your wisdom Guide me in Your ways Jesus Christ my Saviour Redeemer, my Lord!
