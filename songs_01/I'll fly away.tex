\songtitle{I'll fly away}
\begin{song}

Some glad morning when this life is over, \\
I'll fly away! \\
To a home on God's celestial shore, \\
I'll fly away!

I'll fly away, oh, Glory, I'll fly away! \\
When I die, Hallelujah, by and by, \\
I'll fly away!

When the shadows of this life have gone, \\
I'll fly away; \\
like a bird from prison bars has flown, \\
I'll fly away.

Just a few more weary days and then \\
I'll fly away. \\
To a land where joy shall never end \\
I'll fly away!
\end{song}
