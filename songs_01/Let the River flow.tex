\songtitle{Let the River flow}
\begin{song}

Let the poor man say “I am rich in him” Let the lost man say “I am found in him” Oh, let the river flow

Let the blind man say “I can see again” Let the dead man say “I am born again” \\
Oh, let the river flow, Oh, let the river flow

Let the river flow Let the river flow Holy Spirit, come move in power \\
Let the river flow (4x)
\end{song}
