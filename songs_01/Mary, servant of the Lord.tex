\songtitle{Mary, servant of the Lord}
\begin{song}

Mary, servant of the Lord, \\
you gave birth to him who made us all; \\
Mary, mother of our God, \\
blessed virgin, hear our prayer!

Today we choose you, Mary, \\
standing before all the saints, \\
to be our Mother and our Queen!

We dedicate ourselves to you, \\
in humility and love; \\
our bodies and our souls, \\
our gifts and our possessions, \\
the merit of good deeds, \\
those present, past and still to come.

We freely give you the right to deal with us and everything we have, \\
as you see fit, for the greater glory of God, both now and for eternity.
\end{song}
