\songtitle{Come closer}
\begin{song}

Come closer, all you who carly heavy load. \\
Come closer, all you who are weighed down. \\
I offer relief to the weary. \\
I offer relief to the weary.

Take my yoke upon your sholder, \\
for I am gentle, humble is my heart. \\
Come, learn from me, see my yoke is light, \\
like the burden I will give you. \\
Come and learn from me.

As a child rests in its mother's arms, \\
in You, o Lord, my soul remains in peace. \\
O Israel, hope in the light, l \\
ike the burden I will give you. \\
Come and learn from me.
\end{song}
