\songtitle{Without seeing You}
\begin{song}

We return to You deep within, leave the past to the dust; \\
turn to You with tears and fasting; You are ready to forgive.

Without seeing You we love You. Without touching You we embrace. Without seeing You we follow. \\
Without seeing You we believe.

The sparrow will find a home near to You, O God. \\
How happy we who dwell with You, forever in your house.

Forever we sing to You of your goodness, O God; \\
proclaiming to all the world of your faithfulness and love.

For You are our shepherd, there is nothing we need. \\
In green pastures we will find our rest, near the waters of peace.
\end{song}
