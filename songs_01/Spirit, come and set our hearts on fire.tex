\songtitle{Spirit, come and set our hearts on fire}
\begin{song}

Spirit, come and set our hearts on fire; \\
put a new song on our lips to praise You. \\
Spirit, come and fill us with your power, \\
so the world may know of your great love!

Show us, how to turn to Jesus, \\
help us follow Him. \\
Give us joy and peace which nothing can destroy.

All our burdens and our cares \\
we lay before your feet; \\
comforter of souls, we find our rest in you.

From our sins you set us free, \\
o Spirit of all truth, \\
give us the desire to live in holiness.

Help us hear the Word of God \\
and live it in our lives. \\
Let us learn from Mary, trusting in his Word.

May our hearts be filled with faith, \\
let love renew our lives, \\
burning in our hearts to purify our souls.

Make us instruments to praise \\
the glory of our God, \\
that the world may see the love we bear for all.
