You're rich in love and You're slow to anger. \\
Your name is great and your heart is kind. \\
For all your goodness I will keep on singing \\

Amazing grace! How sweet the sound, \\
that saved a wretch like me! \\
I once was lost, but now I‘m found; \\

and grace my fears relieved, \\
how precious did that grace appear \\
the hour I first believed!

Through many dangers, toils, and snares \\
I have already come; \\
‘tis grace has brought me safe thus far, \\
and grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised good to me, \\
His word my hope secures. \\
He will my shield and portion be \\
as long as life endures.

When we’ve been there ten thousand years \\
bright shining as the sun, \\
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise \\
than when we first begun.

You give us strength for the battle to come, \\

Lord, You alone are the source of our faith, \\
and my mouth …

You gather in all the lost and the strayed, \\

All those whose hope lies in your love alone, \\
and my mouth … \\
They call to You in their anguish of heart, \\
and my mouth … \\
Lord you respond to the cry of their need, \\
and my mouth …

From those who hate me You rescue me, Lord, \\
and my mouth … \\
You give me victory over my foes, \\

You go before me; you shield my way. \\
Your hand upholds me \\

\songtitle{21. Away in a manger}
\begin{song}

Away in a manger, no crib for a bed, \\
the little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head. \\
The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay, \\
the little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.

The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes, \\
but little Lord Jesus no crying He makes. \\
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky \\
and stay by my side until morning is nigh.

Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay \\
close by me forever, and love me, I pray. \\
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care, \\
and fit us for heaven, to live with Thee there.

\songtitle{22. Awesome God}
\begin{song}

When He rolls up His sleeves \\
He ain't just putting on the ritz. \\
(Our God is an awesome God!) \\
There's thunder in His footsteps \\
and lightning in His fists. \\
(Our God is an awesome God!)

And the Lord wasn't joking \\
when He kicked 'em out of Eden. \\
It wasn't for no reason \\
that He shed His blood. \\
His return is very close \\
and so you better be believing that \\
our God is an awesome God!

\begin{chorus}
    Our God is an awesome God, \\
    He reigns from heaven above \\
    with wisdom, power, and love, \\
    our God is an awesome God.
\end{chorus}

And when the sky was starless \\
in the void of the night, \\
(Our God is an awesome God!) \\
He spoke into the darkness \\
and created the light. \\
(Our God is an awesome God!)

Judgement and wrath \\
He poured out on Sodom, \\
mercy and grace \\
He gave us at the cross. \\
I hope that we have not \\
too quickly forgotten that \\
our God is an awesome God.

\songtitle{23. Be Not Afraid}
\begin{song}

You shall cross the barren desert, \\
but you shall not die of thirst. \\
You shall wander far in safety \\
though you do not know the way. \\
You shall speak your words in foreign lands \\
and all will understand. \\
You shall see the face of God and live.

\begin{chorus}
    Be not afraid. \\
    I go before you always. \\
    Come, follow me, and I will give you rest.
\end{chorus}

If you pass through raging waters in the sea, \\
you shall not drown. \\
If you walk amid the burning flames, \\
you shall not be harmed. \\
If you stand before the pow’r of hell \\
and death is at your side, \\
know that I am with you through it all.

Blessed are your poor, \\
for the kingdom shall be theirs.

Blest are you that weep and mourn, \\
for one day you shall laugh. \\
And if wicked tongues insult and hate you \\
all because of me, \\
blessed, blessed are you!

Be still, for the presence of the Lord, \\
the Holy One, is here.

Be still, for the glory of the Lord \\
is shining all around; \\
He burns with holy fire, \\
with splendor He is crowned. \\
How awesome is the sight, \\
our radiant King of light! \\
Be still, for the glory of the \\
Lord is shining all around.

Be still, for the power of the Lord \\
is moving in this place. \\
He comes to cleanse and heal, \\

No work too hard for him. \\
In faith receive from him. \\
Be still, for the power of the Lord \\
is moving in this place.

waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

Be Thou my wisdom, and Thou my true word; \\

Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

Riches I heed not, or man’s empty praise, \\

high King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.

\songtitle{27. Because He lives}
\begin{song}

God sent His son, they called Him Jesus; \\
He came to love, heal and forgive; \\
He lived and died to buy my pardon, \\
an empty grave is there to prove \\
my Savior lives!

\begin{chorus}
    Because He lives, I can face tomorrow, \\
    because He lives, all fear is gone; \\
    because I know He holds the future, \\
    and life is worth the living, \\
    just because He lives!
\end{chorus}

How sweet to hold a newborn baby, \\
and feel the pride and joy he brings; \\
but greater still the calm assurance: \\
this child can face uncertain days \\
because He Lives!

And then one day, I'll cross the river, \\
I'll fight life's final war with pain; \\
and then, as death gives way to victory, \\
I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives!
\end{song}


\songtitle{28. Behold the Lamb}
\begin{song}

Behold the Lamb who bears our sins away, \\
slain for us: and we remember \\
the promise made that all who come in faith \\
find forgiveness at the cross. \\
So we share in this bread of life, \\
and we drink of His sacrifice, \\
as a sign of our bonds of peace \\
around the table of the King.

The body of our Saviour Jesus Christ, \\
torn for you: eat and remember \\
the wounds that heal, the death that brings us life, \\
paid the price to make us one. \\
So we share in this bread of life, \\
and we drink of His sacrifice, \\
as a sign of our bonds of love \\
around the table of the King.

The blood that cleanses ev’ry stain of sin, \\
shed for You: drink and remember \\
He drained death's cup that all may enter in \\
to receive the life of God. \\
So we share in this bread of life, \\
and we drink of His sacrifice, \\
as a sign of our bonds of grace \\
around the table of the King.

And so with thankfulness and faith we rise \\
to respond and to remember \\
our call to follow in the steps of Christ \\
as His body here on earth. \\
as we share in His suffering \\
we proclaim: Christ will come again! \\
And we’ll join in the feast of heav’n \\
around the table of the King.

\end{chorus}

He will release me from the nets of all my foes. \\
He will protect me from their wicked hands. \\
Beneath the shadow of His wings I will rejoice \\
to find a dwelling place secure.

I need not shrink before the terrors of the night, \\
nor stand alone before the light of day. \\
No harm shall come to me, no arrow strike me down, \\
no evil settle in my soul.

Although a thousand strong have fallen at my side, \\

His faithful love is all the armor that I need \\

Hands that healed nations stretched out on a tree \\
and took the nails for me.

One day the grave could conceal Him no longer. \\
One day the stone rolled away from the door. \\
Then He arose over death He had conquered, \\
now He's ascended my Lord evermore! \\
Death could not hold Him, \\
the grave could not keep Him \\
from rising again!

One day the trumpet will sound for His coming. \\
One day the skies with His glories will shine. \\
Wonderful day my Beloved One, bringing \\
My Savior, Jesus, is mine!

\begin{song}

How deep the Father's love for us, \\
how vast beyond all measure, \\
that He should give His only Son \\
and make a wretch His treasure?

How great the pain of searing loss, \\
the Father turns His face away \\
as wounds which mar the Chosen One \\
bring many sons to glory.

Behold the Man upon the cross, \\
my sin upon His shoulder, \\
ashamed I hear my mocking voice \\
call out among the scoffers.

It was my sin that held Him there \\
until it was accomplished. \\
His dying breath has brought me life, \\
I know that it is finished.

I will not boast in anything, \\
no gifts, no power, no wisdom. \\
But I will boast in Jesus Christ, \\
his death and resurrection.

Why should I gain from His reward, \\
I cannot give an answer. \\
But this I know with all my heart, \\
His wounds have paid my ransom.

Beginning and the end, beginning and the end. \\
The Godhead Three in One: Father, Spirit, Son. \\
The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb.

He’s the name above all names. \\
You are worthy of all praise. \\
My heart will sing \\
“How great is our God!”

O Lord My God, when I in awesome wonder \\
consider all the works Thy hands have made. \\
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder, \\
Thy power throughout the universe displayed.

\begin{chorus}
    Then sings my soul, \\
    my Savior God, to Thee, \\
    how great Thou art, \\
    how great Thou art! (repeat)
\end{chorus}

When through the woods and forest glades I wander, \\
and hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees. \\
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur \\
and hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze.

And when I think that God, His Son not sparing, \\
sent Him to die I scarce can take it in, \\
that on the cross, my burden gladly bearing, \\
He bled and died to take away my sin.

When Christ shall come with shouts of acclamation \\
and take me home, what joy shall fill my heart. \\
Then I shall bow in humble adoration \\
and there proclaim my God, how great Thou art.

\songtitle{113. In Christ alone}
\begin{song}

In Christ alone my hope is found. \\
He is my light, my strength, my song. \\
This Cornerstone, this solid Ground, \\
firm through the fiercest drought and storm. \\
What heights of love, what depths of peace, \\
when fears are stilled when strivings cease! \\
My Comforter, my all in all, \\
here in the love of Christ I stand.

In Christ alone! Who took on flesh \\
fullness of God in helpless babe! \\
This gift of love and righteousness, \\
scorned by the ones He came to save. \\
Till on that cross as Jesus died, \\
the wrath of God was satisfied. \\
For every sin on Him was laid \\
here in the death of Christ I live.

There in the ground His body lay, \\
Light of the world by darkness slain. \\
Then bursting forth in glorious Day \\
up from the grave He rose again! \\
And as He stands in victory \\
sin's curse has lost its grip on me. \\
For I am his and He is mine. \\
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death. \\
This is the power of Christ in me. \\
From life's first cry to final breath \\
Jesus commands my destiny. \\
No power of hell no scheme of man \\
can ever pluck me from His hand. \\
Till He returns or calls me home, \\
here in the power of Christ I'll stand.

    In God alone my heart rests secure, \\
    from Him come my safety and help, \\
    for He is my rock, He alone my joy and strength; \\
    I know I can depend on his love.
\end{chorus}

Trust in Him, o people of God always. \\
Pour out your hearts to Him now; \\
for our God is strong to save us, \\
He bears our troubles for us; \\
our rock our mighty fortress; \\
He is all our hope.

My people put no faith in this world's goods, \\
set your hearts free of its wealth. \\
For with God it counts for nothing, \\
A feather on the balance: \\
Yes, God knows all our longings; \\
he provides for all.

May love be our home; rest to soothe tired bones. \\
May love be healing for our wounds. \\
May love speak the truth; free us from our fear. \\

May love be the sun shining in our darkness. \\
May love fill the lives of our children. \\
May love be our strength, to live a life of justice. \\
May love be our call to live the Kingdom!

for the spring and the fountains \\
bring new life to the barren land.

You shall see the glory of God, \\
and the majesty of the Lord, \\
say to all the faint hearts, \\
do not fear, our God has come to save.

He has come to bring us new life, \\
let our hearts receive him in joy, \\
For God loves us so much, \\
to ransom us from death.

\songtitle{117. In the bleak midwinter}
\begin{song}

In the bleak midwinter \\
frosty wind made moan, \\
earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone: \\
snow had fallen, snow on snow, \\
snow on snow, \\
in the bleak midwinter, long ago.

Our God, heaven cannot hold him, \\
nor earth sustain; \\
heaven and earth shall flee away \\
when he comes to reign: \\
in the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed \\
the Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.

Angels and archangels \\
may have gathered there, \\
cherubim and seraphim thronged the air, \\
but only his mother, in her maiden bliss, \\
worshiped the Beloved with a kiss.

What can I give him, poor as I am? \\
If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb, \\
if I were a wise man I would do my part, \\
yet what I can I give him, give my heart.

    it is well, \\
    it is well with my soul
\end{chorus}

My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought! \\
My sin, not in part but the whole \\
is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more. \\
Praise the Lord praise the Lord, O my soul! \\
For me, be it Christ be it Christ hence to live. \\
If Jordan above me shall roll \\
no pang shall be mine for in death as in life, \\
Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.

But Lord, 'tis for Thee for Thy coming we wait \\
The sky, not the grave, is our goal. \\
Oh, trump of the angel! Oh, voice of the Lord! \\
Blessed hope blessed rest of my soul.

And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight \\
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll \\
The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend \\
Even so it is well with my soul.

You will come to the truth, \\

If you love me. you must learn \\
to take up your cross, \\
but to lose life for me \\
is a gain not a loss. \\
Come and follow me!

I am king but my kingdom \\
is not of this earth, \\
for all those who believe in me, \\
come to new birth. \\
They belong to me!

He will come once again \\
to reward those He loves, \\
when we all will return \\
to our Father above. \\
To Him glory be!

From his side flowed the water \\
of life ever more, \\
and our lives witness now \\
the love which He bore. \\
Then our eyes will see!

And the morning that You rose, \\
all of Heaven held its breath, \\
'Til that stone was moved for good, \\
for the Lamb had conquered death \\
and the dead rose from their tombs \\
and the angels stood in awe, \\
for the souls of all who'd come \\
to the Father are restored.

And the church of Christ was born, \\
then the Spirit lit the flame. \\
Now this gospel truth of old \\
shall not kneel, shall not faint. \\
By His blood and in His name, \\
in His freedom I am free! \\
For the love of Jesus Christ, \\
who has resurrected me.

Lead, kindly Light, amid th'encircling gloom, \\
lead thou me on! \\
The night is dark, and I am far from home, \\

Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see \\
the distant scene—one step enough for me.

I was not ever thus, nor pray'd that thou \\

I loved to choose and see my path; but now \\
lead thou me on! \\
I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears \\
pride ruled my will. Remember not past years.

So long thy pow'r hath blest me, sure it still \\
will lead me on. \\
O'er moor and fen, o'er crag and torrent, till \\
the night is gone. \\
And with the morn those angel faces smile \\
which I have loved long since, and lost awhile!

Meantime, along the narrow rugged path, \\
thyself hast trod, Lead, Saviour, \\
lead med home in childlike faith, \\
home to my God. \\
To rest forever after earthly strife \\
in the calm light of everlasting life.

Led by the Spirit of our God, \\
we go to fast and pray \\
with Christ into the wilderness; \\
we join his paschal way. \\
"Rend not your garments, rend your hearts. \\
Turn back your lives to me." \\
Thus says our kind and gracious God, \\
whose reign is liberty.

Led by the Spirit, \\
we confront temptation face to face, \\
And know full well we must rely \\
on God's redeeming grace. \\
On bread alone we cannot live, \\
but nourished by the Word. \\
We seek the will of God to do: \\
this is our drink and food.

Led by the Spirit, \\
now draw near the waters of rebirth \\
with hearts that long to worship God \\
in spirit and in truth. \\
"Whoever drinks the drink \\

\songtitle{167. My song is love unknown}
\begin{song}

My song is love unknown – \\
my Savior’s love to me; \\
love to the loveless shown, \\
that they might lovely be. \\
Oh, who am I, that for my sake \\
my Lord should take frail flesh and die?

He came from His blest throne \\
salvation to bestow; \\
but men made strange, and none \\
the longed for Christ would know. \\
But oh, my Friend, my Friend indeed, \\
who at my need His life did spend!

Sometimes they strew His way, \\
and His sweet praises sing; \\
resounding all the day \\
hosannas to their King. \\
Then “Crucify!” is all their breath, \\
and for His death they thirst and cry.

Why, what hath my Lord done? \\
What makes this rage and spite? \\
He made the lame to run; \\
He gave the blind their sight. \\
Sweet injuries! Yet they at these \\
themselves displease, \\
and 'gainst Him rise.

They rise, and needs will have \\
my dear Lord made away. \\
A murderer they save; \\
the Prince of Life they slay. \\
Yet cheerful He to suff'ring goes, \\
that He His foes from thence might free.

In life, no house, no home \\
my Lord on earth might have; \\
in death, no friendly tomb \\
but what a stranger gave. \\
What may I say? Heav'n was His home; \\
but mine the tomb wherein He lay.

Here might I stay and sing– \\
no story so divine! \\
Never was love, dear King, \\
never was grief like Thine. \\
This is my Friend, in whose sweet praise \\
I all my days could gladly spend.

Jesus, send your Spirit \\
Jesus, send your Spirit, Lord, \\
As you promised us, we are asking you, \\
O Lord, pour out your fire on the earth, \\
Jesus, my life is in your hands.

Darkness be over me, my rest a stone; \\
Yet in my dreams I'd be nearer, my God, to Thee,

There let the way appear steps unto heav'n; \\
All that Thou sendest me in mercy giv'n; \\
Angels to beckon me nearer, my God, to Thee,

Then with my waking thoughts bright with Thy praise, \\
Out of my stony griefs Bethel I'll raise; \\
So by my woes to be nearer, my God, to Thee,

Or if on joyful wing, cleaving the sky, \\
Sun, moon, and stars forgot, upwards I’ll fly, \\
Still all my song shall be, nearer, my God, to Thee,

O morning stars, together \\
Proclaim the holy birth. \\
And praises sing to God the King, \\
And Peace to men on earth, \\
For Christ is born of Mary. \\
And gathered all above, \\
While mortals sleep, the angels keep \\
Their watch of wond'ring love.

How silently, how silently, \\
The wondrous gift is giv'n! \\
So God imparts to human hearts \\
The blessings of His heav'n. \\
No ear may hear His coming, \\
But in this world of sin, \\
Where meek souls will receive him still, \\
The dear Christ enters in.

O holy Child of Bethlehem, \\
Descend to us, we pray, \\
Cast out our sin and enter in, \\
Be born to us today. \\
We hear the Christmas angels, \\
The great glad tidings tell: \\
O come to us, abide with us, \\
Our Lord Emmanuel.

\begin{song}

O Love that will not let me go, \\
I rest my weary soul in Thee. \\
I give Thee back the life I owe \\
that in Thine oceans depths its flow \\
may richer, fuller be.

O Light that follows all my way \\
I yield my flickering torch to Thee. \\
My heart restores its borrowed ray \\
that in Thy sunshine's blaze its day \\
may brighter, fairer be.

O Joy that seekest me through pain \\
I cannot close my heart to Thee. \\
I trace the rainbow through the rain \\
and feel the promise is not vain: \\
that morn shall tearless be.

O Cross that liftest up my head \\
I dare not ask to fly from Thee. \\
I lay in dust life's glory dead \\
and from the ground there blossoms red \\
life that shall endless be.

You believed that God fulfils his word \\
as th'angel spoke to you: \\
yes, nothing is impossible to God!

We ask You, with our mother, we implore You! \\
Take away out fear and we'll proclaim You, \\
set our world on fire! \\
Lord, give your power, make us your apostles.

You call me out upon the waters, \\
the great unknown, where feet may fail. \\

The snare of the fowler will never capture you, \\
and famine will bring you no fear: \\
under his wings your refuge, \\
his faithfulness your shield.

You need not fear the terror of the night, \\
nor the arrow that flies by day; \\
though thousands fall about you, \\
near you it shall not come.

For to his angels He’s given a command \\
to guard you in all of your ways; \\
upon their hands they will bear you up, \\
lest you dash your foot against a stone.

Jesus Christ, I think upon your sacrifice: \\

Many times I've wondered at your gift of life, \\

    And once again I look upon the cross where You died: \\
    I'm humbled by your mercy and I'm broken inside, \\
    once again I thank You, \\
    once again I pour out my life.
\end{chorus}

Now You are exalted to the highest place - \\
King of the Heavens - where one day I'll bow, \\
but for now, I marvel at this saving grace, \\
and I'm full of praise once again, \\
I'm full of praise once again.

Thank You for the cross, \\

    Lord help me today, show me the way, \\
    one day at a time.
\end{chorus}

I'm only human, I'm just a woman. \\
Help me believe in what I could be \\
and all that I am. \\
Show me the stairway I have to climb, \\
Lord for my sake teach me to take \\
one day at a time.

Do You remember when you walked among men? \\
Well Jesus You know if You're looking below \\

Cheating and stealing, violence and crime. \\
So for my sake, teach me to take \\
one day at a time.

    all around, all around.
\end{chorus}

Your people have grown weary \\
of living in confusion. \\
When will we realize \\
that neither heaven is at peace, \\
when we will live not in peace.

Grant me serenity within, \\
for the confusions around \\
are mere reflections of what's within ... \\
what's within in me.

are the feet of him who brings good news, \\
good news; announcing peace, \\
proclaiming news of happiness: \\
our God reigns, our God reigns!

Our God reigns, our God reigns, \\
our God reigns, our God reigns!

He had no stately form, He had no majesty \\
that we should be drawn to Him. \\
He was despised \\
and we took no account of Him, \\
yet now He reigns with the Most High!

It was our sin and guilt that bruised and wounded Him; \\
it was our sin that brought Him down. \\
When we like sheep had gone astray, \\
our shepherd came and on his shoulders bore our shame!

Meek as a lamb that’s led out to the slaughterhouse, \\
still as a sheep before its shearer, \\
his life ran down upon the ground like pouring rain \\
that we might be born again!

Nobis datus, nobis natus \\
Ex intacta Virgine \\

Miro clausit ordine.

In supremae nocte coenae \\

Ad firmandum cor sincerum \\
Sola fides sufficit.

Tantum ergo Sacramentum \\

Procedenti ab utroque \\
Compar sit laudatio. \\

All who see me scoff at me; \\
they mock me with parted lips, they wag their heads: \\
"He relied on the LORD; let him deliver him, \\
let him rescue him, if he loves him."

Indeed, many dogs surround me, \\
a pack of evildoers closes in upon me; \\

I can count all my bones.

They divide my garments among them, \\
and for my vesture they cast lots. \\
But you, O LORD, be not far from me; \\
O my help, hasten to aid me.

I will proclaim your name to my brethren; \\

soon to wither?

Listen to me, my people; \\

Through death into life everlasting \\
He passed, and we follow Him there; \\

Then go to a world that is dying, \\
His perfect salvation to tell!

Wait for the Lord and stay quiet. \\
Wait for the Lord, for his light. \\

Stay in Jerusalem, stay. \\
Wait for Father to work. \\

you´ll receive the power too, \\
and you´ll be my witnesses throughout the earth.”

“Ask, you will surely receive. \\
You´ll hear my voice when you call.” \\
For the Father knows us all. \\
He will never let us fall. \\
He will give us food that lasts eternally

On the eighth day, evening came. \\
I heard his voice, still the same. \\
“Put your finger in my side, Thomas, \\
leave your doubts behind” \\
Full of joy, I cried aloud: “My Lord, my God!”

“Now you have seen, you believe. \\
Now you have touched with your hand. \\
But how happy are the ones, \\
who will hear of what you´ve done. \\
They will neither touch nor see, \\
yet they'll believe.”

Gabriel came close to me. \\
“Mary, do not be afraid! \\
For the Spirit will come down \\
and a son you will conceive. \\
For the people, he will be Emmanuel”

All of my fear fell away. \\
In the Lord's presence, I stayed. \\

May it all be done to me, as you have said”

Myrrh is mine: its bitter perfume \\

    Humble servant, least among the men. \\
    Holy One of God, the poorest of the poor. \\
    You have made your home among us, Lord!

The bread you give to eat, the wine you give to drink, \\
is your body and blood. \\
You offer up your life, your heart is pierced for us, \\
You have made your home among us, Lord!

In this communion, Lord, you come to dwell in us, \\
burning furnace of love. \\
The heart that loved so much, is thirsty for our hearts. \\
You have made your home among us, Lord.

The life we have received transformed our hearts of stone: \\
tabernacles of Christ. \\
You send us to the world, to reach out to the lost. \\
You have made your home among us, Lord.

\begin{song}

When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary, \\
When troubles come and my heart burdened be. \\
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence, \\
Until you come and sit awhile with me.

    You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains. \\
    You raise me up to walk on stormy seas. \\
    I am strong, when I am on your shoulders. \\
    You raise me up to more than I can be!

There is no life – no life without its hunger, \\
Each restless heart beats so imperfectly. \\
But when you come and I am filled with wonder, \\
sometimes, I think I glimpse eternity.

I will bring forth life in the wasteland.

I will breathe my life in you \\
and raise you from your graves. \\
Then you shall know I am the Lord God.

I will make a covenant \\
of lasting peace with you. \\
I will dwell forever among you.
