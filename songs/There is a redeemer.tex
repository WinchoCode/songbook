\songtitle{There is a redeemer}
\begin{song}

There is a Redeemer: Jesus, God's own Son; \\
precious Lamb of God, Messiah, \\
Holy One.

\begin{chorus}
    Thank You, O my Father, \\
    for giving us your Son, \\
    and leaving your Spirit \\
    till the work on earth is done.
\end{chorus}

When I stand in glory, I will see His face. \\
Jesus, my Redeemer, name above all names; \\
precious Lamb of God, Messiah, \\
o for sinners slain.

When I stand in glory, I will see His face. \\
There I'll serve my King forever \\
in that holy place.
\end{song}
