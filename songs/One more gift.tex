\songtitle{One more gift}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    If there's one more gift I'd ask of You, Lord \\
    it would be peace here on earth, \\
    As gentle as Your children's laughter \\
    all around, all around.
\end{chorus}

Your people have grown weary \\
of living in confusion. \\
When will we realize \\
that neither heaven is at peace, \\
when we will live not in peace.

Grant me serenity within, \\
for the confusions around \\
are mere reflections of what's within ... \\
what's within in me.
\end{song}
