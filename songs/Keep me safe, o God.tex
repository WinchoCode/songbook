\songtitle{Keep me safe, o God}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    Keep me safe, O God! \\
    Keep me safe; You are my hope, my God. \\
    Keep me safe, O God! \\
    Keep me safe; You are my hope, my God.
\end{chorus}

O God, You are my portion and my cup; \\
it is You who are so very faithful. \\
O God, it is only You I serve. \\
With You, I am never alone.

My soul rejoices and my heart is glad; \\
it is You, O God, where I find safety. \\
Faithful is the promise that You give. \\
My heart and my soul rejoice.

The path of life is where I follow You, \\
full of joy, to bring your ways of justice. \\
You lead me to choose the path of life \\
and walk in the light of your love.
\end{song}
