\songtitle{Bread of Life}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    Bread of life \\
    hope of the world \\
    Jesus Christ, our brother \\
    Feed us now, give us life \\
    Lead us to one another
\end{chorus}

As we proclaim your death \\
as we recall your life \\
we remember your promise \\
to return again

The bread we break and share \\
was scattered once as grain \\
Just as now it is gathered \\
make your people one

We eat this living bread \\
we drink this saving cup \\
Sign of hope in our broken world \\
source of lasting love

Hold us in unity \\
in love for all to see \\
that the world may believe in you, \\
God of all who live

You are the bread of peace \\
you are the wine of joy \\
broken now for your people \\
poured in endless love
\end{song}
