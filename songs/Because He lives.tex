\songtitle{Because He lives}
\begin{song}

God sent His son, they called Him Jesus; \\
He came to love, heal and forgive; \\
He lived and died to buy my pardon, \\
an empty grave is there to prove \\
my Savior lives!

\begin{chorus}
    Because He lives, I can face tomorrow, \\
    because He lives, all fear is gone; \\
    because I know He holds the future, \\
    and life is worth the living, \\
    just because He lives!
\end{chorus}

How sweet to hold a newborn baby, \\
and feel the pride and joy he brings; \\
but greater still the calm assurance: \\
this child can face uncertain days \\
because He Lives!

And then one day, I'll cross the river, \\
I'll fight life's final war with pain; \\
and then, as death gives way to victory, \\
I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives!
\end{song}
