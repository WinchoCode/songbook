\songtitle{Joy to the world}
\begin{song}

Joy to the world, the Lord is come! \\
Let earth receive her King; \\
Let every heart prepare Him room, \\
And heav'n and nature sing, \\
And heav'n and nature sing, \\
And heav'n, and heav'n, and nature sing.

Joy to the world, the Savior reigns! \\
Let us our songs employ; \\
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains \\
Repeat the sounding joy, \\
Repeat the sounding joy, \\
Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy.

He rules the world with truth and grace, \\
And makes the nations prove \\
The glories of His righteousness, \\
And wonders of His love, \\
And wonders of His love, \\
And wonders, wonders, of His love.
\end{song}
