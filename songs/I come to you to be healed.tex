\songtitle{I come to you to be healed}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    I come to you, I come to you, \\
    to be healed, refreshed, renewed. (2x)
\end{chorus}

When I ask in your name, you grant me anything. \\
My Lord, come now, pour your Spirit over me.

I turn to you, when darkness covers me. \\
It it through you that I will find my rest.

You showed me how to be one with our Father. \\
My rock, my strength, I need you today.
\end{song}
