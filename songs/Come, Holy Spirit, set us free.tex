\songtitle{Come, Holy Spirit, Set Us Free}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
Come, Holy Spirit, set us free, \\
Come, Holy Spirit, let us see; \\
Come, Holy Spirit, ever be \\
Here, deep in our hearts.
\end{chorus}

You, who proceed from the Father and Son, \\
O Spirit of all truth instruct our minds. \\
Spirit of love, \\
Set our hearts on fire!

Water of life, come to heal every wound, \\
O breath of God on high, give us your peace. \\
Fire of love, \\
Burn our sin away!

Spirit of peace, cleanse our hearts of all grief; \\
O Spirit of all joy, come sing in us. \\
Spirit of life, \\
Give your life divine!
\end{song}
