\songtitle{O Maria, you're the mother}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    O Maria, you're the mother of our Lord. \\
    It was through your Yes, \\
    that the Word became flesh: \\
    Jesus, our Lord.

    (O Maria, you're the mother of us all. \\
    Pray with us to the Lord, \\
    for he gave us this word: \\
    Holy Spirit, come!)
\end{chorus}

When the angel came to you announcing Christ would soon be born, \\
it was God himself who visited his people. \\
The power from on high, \\
the Holy Spirit came to you: \\
your child is “Son of God, Emmanuel”.

Your presence, Mary, \\
gives us hope and helps us to believe, \\
that the grace of God is \\
stronger than our weakness. \\
You believed that God fulfils his word \\
as th'angel spoke to you: \\
yes, nothing is impossible to God!

O Lord, send out your Holy Spirit \\
as You promised us. \\
We ask You, with our mother, we implore You! \\
Take away out fear and we'll proclaim You, \\
set our world on fire! Lord, give your power, make us your apostles.
\end{song}
