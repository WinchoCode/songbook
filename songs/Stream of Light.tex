\songtitle{Stream of Light}
\begin{song}

Stream of light immortal, \\
come, enlighten me. \\
Come, Restorer of my joys, \\
give me life again. \\
You alone I long for, \\
long to see Your face, \\
Jesus Christ, my Saviour, \\
Redeemer, my Lord!

Purifying fire, \\
burn my sin away. \\
Change my heart to \\
love like Yours in humility. \\
Set my soul aflame, \\
alight with Your own love. \\
Jesus Christ, my Saviour, \\
Redeemer, my Lord!

Pardon all my sins, Lord, \\
healing all my wounds. \\
Take my offering of love, \\
little though it be. \\
In Your gentle mercy \\
all me with your peace. \\
Jesus Christ, my Saviour, \\
Redeemer, my Lord!

Let me seek Your Word, Lord, \\
let me hear your voice. \\
May I learn Your will for me, \\
let my faith increase. \\
Teach me in Your wisdom, \\
guide me in Your ways. \\
Jesus Christ, my Saviour \\
Redeemer, my Lord!
