\songtitle{Here I am, Lord}
\begin{song}

I, the Lord of sea and sky, \\
I have heard My people cry. \\
All who dwell in dark and sin, \\
my hand will save. \\
I, who made the stars of night, \\
I will make their darkness bright. \\
Who will bear my light to them? \\
Whom shall I send?

\begin{chorus}
    Here I am, Lord. Is it I, Lord? \\
    I have heard You calling in the night. \\
    I will go, Lord, if You lead me. \\
    I will hold Your people in my heart.
\end{chorus}

I, the Lord of snow and rain, \\
I have borne my people’s pain, \\
I have wept for love of them, \\
they turn away. \\
I will break their hearts of stone, \\
give them hearts for love alone, \\
I will speak my word to them, \\
whom shall I send?

I, the Lord of wind and flame, \\
I will tend the poor and lame, \\
I will set a feast for them, \\
my hand will save. \\
Finest bread I will provide, \\
till their hearts be satisfied. \\
I will give my life to them,\\
whom shall I send?
\end{song}
