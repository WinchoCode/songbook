\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    I will sing forever of Your love, O Lord. \\
    I will celebrate the wonder of Your name. \\
    For the word that You speak \\
    is a song of forgiveness \\
    and a song of gentle mercy and of peace.
\end{chorus}

Let us wake at the morning and be filled with \\
Your love and sing songs of praise all our days. \\
For Your love is as high as the heavens above us, \\
and Your faithfulness as certain as the dawn.

I will sing forever of Your love, O Lord, \\
for You are my refuge and my strength. \\
You fill the world with Your life-giving spirit \\
that speaks Your word, \\
Your word of mercy and of peace.
\end{song}
