Praise the Lord for he is good, alleluia, \\
and his love it has no end, alleluia, \\
to the East and to the West, alleluia, \\
let us proclaim unending love, alleluia!

The father longed to send his Son, alleluia, \\
out of love for everyone, alleluia, \\
Mary said let it be done, alleluia, \\
so Christ the Lord came to be born, alleluia!

Jesus came to set us free, alleluia, \\
from our sin and from our strife, alleluia, \\
victory comes from his cross, alleluia, \\
he feeds us with the Bread of Life, alleluia!

Jesus is alive today, alleluia, \\
his own heart, true source of love, alleluia, \\
spiritfilled, we go our way, alleluia, \\
to tell the world that God is love, alleluia!
