\songtitle{Come, Lord Jesus}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    Come, Lord Jesus, come. \\
    Come and fill my heart with your life. \\
    Hold me close, Lord, hold me tight, \\
    And come, Lord Jesus, come.
\end{chorus}

Where there’s despair in life, Lord, \\
Let me be your voice of hope. \\
Where there’s injury, Lord, \\
Let me be your voice of peace.

Where there is sadness \\
Let me be your comfort and your joy. \\
When there’s fear in our hearts \\
Let me be a sign of faith.
\end{song}
