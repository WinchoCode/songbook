\songtitle{Do not be worried and upset}
\begin{song}

Do not be worried and upset. \\
Believe in God, believe also in me. \\
There are many rooms in my Father’s house, \\
and I’m going to prepare a place, \\
prepare a place for you.

\begin{chorus}
    I am the way, the truth and the life; \\
    no one goes to the Father except by me. \\
    I am the way, the truth and the life, \\
    and I’m going to prepare a place, \\
    prepare a place for you.
\end{chorus}

After I go and prepare a place for you, \\
I will come back and take you to myself, \\
so that you may come and be where I am. \\
And I’m going to prepare a place, \\
prepare a place for you.
\end{song}
