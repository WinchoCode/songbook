\songtitle{I lift my eyes}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    I lift my eyes to the mountains, \\
    where will my help come from? \\
    My help comes from the Lord, \\
    who made heaven and earth! \\
    My help comes from the Lord, \\
    who made heaven and earth!
\end{chorus}

He will not let you fall, \\
the protector is awake, \\
the protector of Israel \\
never slumber or sleeps.

He the Lord will guard your life, \\
by your side protecting you, \\
the sun won't strike you down by day, \\
or moon at night.

He will guard you from all harm, \\
He will guard you, keep you safe, \\
in your leaving and your coming back, \\
now and for always.
\end{song}
