\songtitle{Speak, Lord}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    Speak, Lord, I’m listening. \\
    Plant your word down deep in me. Speak, Lord, I’m listening. \\
    Please show me the way.
\end{chorus}

Sometimes my heart is slow to follow You; \\
Teach me to hear and understand; \\
And I’m told the things You promise; \\
And I hope they all come true; \\
And I know what waits for those who wait; \\
And put their trust in You.

Sometimes I stumble on my way to You; \\
Stretch out again, your healing hand; \\
And I’m told the things You promise; \\
And I hope they all come true; \\
And I know what waits for those who wait; \\
And put their trust in You.
\end{song}
