\songtitle{Here is the gift}
\begin{song}

Here is the gift the Father gives for us. \\
Jesus, our Lord, Son of God, took flesh for us, \\
choosing to live in our midst. \\
The Word of the Father begotten from a virgin, \\
He comes to give us the living word of life.

Here is the Lord who gave up his own life. \\
He died to save us from death and give us life. \\
His love pours out from his side. \\
The Spirit of love flows out over all the earth, \\
that all may share in the gift of God’s own life.

Here is the bread of mercy for the world. \\
Here is the wine for the Lamb of God’s feast. \\
Eat, drink and share in God’s life. \\
This banquet God shares with you is your heritage, \\
which has been kept for you since the dawn of time.

Here is the bride – groom come to meet His church, \\
His bride who’s washed and redeemed by His own Blood, \\
we ask You: come, reign on earth. \\
The whole world is waiting and longing for You, Lord. \\
You are the hope and the life of all the world.
