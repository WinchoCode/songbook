\songtitle{Whatsoever you do}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    Whatsoever you do \\
    to the least of my people, \\
    that you do unto me.
\end{chorus}

When I was hungry, you gave me to eat; \\
When I was thirsty, you gave me to drink. \\
Now enter into the home of my Father.

When I was homeless, you opened your door; \\
When I was naked, you gave me your coat. \\
Now enter into the home of my Father.

When I was weary, you helped me find rest; \\
When I was anxious, you calmed all my fears. \\
Now enter into the home of my Father.

When in a prison, you came to my cell; \\
When on a sickbed, you cared for my needs. \\
Now enter into the home of my Father.

When I was laughed at, you stood by my side; \\
When I was happy, you shared in my joy. \\
Now enter into the home of my Father.
\end{song}
