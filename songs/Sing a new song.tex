\songtitle{Sing a new song}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    Sing a new song unto the Lord; \\
    let your song be sung from mountains high. \\
    Sing a new song unto the Lord, singing alleluia.
\end{chorus}

Shout with gladness! Dance for joy! \\
O come before the Lord. \\
And play for him on glad tambourines, \\
and let your trumpet sound.

Rise, O children, from your sleep; \\
your Savior now has come. \\
He has turned your sorrow to joy \\
and filled your soul with song.

Glad my soul for I have seen \\
the glory of the Lord. \\
The trumpet sounds; the dead shall be raised. \\
I know my Savior lives!
\end{song}
