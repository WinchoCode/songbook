\songtitle{Jesus, my King}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    Jesus, my King! Jesus, my joy! \\
    Jesus, you are here, come to me!
\end{chorus}

O heart of love and of sweetness full, \\
O Heart of peace and of tenderness, \\
O Heart which shared in our misery \\
and offered us on the cross to God, the Father.

O gentle Heart, humble, meek and real, \\
O pure and strong Heart of charity, \\
O heart embracing our sufferings \\
and offring them on the cross to God, the Father.

O glorous heart, burning with true love, \\
from there the source of all life gushed forth, \\
Enarmoured heart opens heav'n for us \\
and offers us to the glory of our Father.
\end{song}
