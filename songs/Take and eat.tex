\songtitle{Take and eat}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    Take and eat: this is my body. \\
    Take and drink: this is my blood. \\
    Open your heart! I give my life; I am with you until the end of time!
\end{chorus}

Come dwell in me, as I dwell in you. \\
Just as the Father has loved me, so I love you. \\
No love is greater than a love that giver its all. \\
No longer servants; I call you my friends!

Ask in my name, what you ask I will do. \\
Then you will know the love my Father has for you. \\
I give my Spirit, He will help you on your way. \\
Do not be troubled. My peace be with you!

I pray for them so that they may be one. \\
One in us, Father, just as you and I are one. \\
May they discover the love you have for me. \\
May they discover your love dwells in them!
\end{song}
