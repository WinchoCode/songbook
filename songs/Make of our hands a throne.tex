\songtitle{Make of our hands a throne}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    Make of our hands a throne \\
    to hold the bread of heaven, \\
    make of our hearts a home \\
    to hold the very wine of life, \\
    in this myst’ry, Lord, \\
    make us one with You.
\end{chorus}

Taste of this goodness! And feast at this banquet; \\
how blest the faithful who find shelter in God! \\
Look to your Maker, be radiant with glory, \\
For those who love the Lord are saved from their fears.

You keep your promise, O God, our Savior, \\
hope of the distant isles and all of the earth. \\
You crown us with goodness, \\
your fields decked with harvest. \\
Your valleys clothed in wheat resound with your joy!

From clouds above us, You send down your blessings, \\
the bread of heaven and the waters of life! \\
You rain down your bounty and kiss us with mana, \\
bread of the angels for our food and feast.
\end{song}
