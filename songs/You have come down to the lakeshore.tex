\songtitle{You have come down to the lakeshore}
\begin{song}

You have come down to the lakeshore \\
seeking neither the wise nor the wealthy, \\
but only asking for me to follow.

\begin{chorus}
O Jesus, you have looked into my eyes, \\
kindly smiling, you’ve called out my name. \\
On the sand I’ve abandoned my small boat; \\
now with you, I will seek other seas.
\end{chorus}

You know full well my possesions;  \\
Neither treasure nor weapons for conquest, \\
Just these my fishnets and will for working.

You need my hands, my exhaustion, \\
Working love for the rest of the weary, \\
A love that’s willing to go on loving.

You who have fished other waters; \\
You, the longing of souls that are yearning; \\
as loving Friend, you have come to call me.
\end{song}
