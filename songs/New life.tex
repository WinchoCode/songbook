\songtitle{New life}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    New life! New life! \\
    You came to bring us new life. \\
    New life! New life! \\
    We find such joy in your abundant life.
\end{chorus}

You are the source of our great joy, \\
the fountain of all life. \\
You give us living water, \\
You bid us come and drink.

We come to You, we bless You, \\
Lord, We glorify your name! \\
We praise You, Lord, we worship You, \\
We thank You for your gift of new life.

You are the source of our new life; \\
in your light we see light. \\
You show to us your goodness; \\
You bid us taste and see. \\
We come to You, we bless You, \\
Lord, We glorify your name! \\
We praise You, Lord, we worship You, \\
We thank You for your gift of new life.
