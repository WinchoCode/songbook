\songtitle{You Are Worthy Of My Praise}
\begin{song}

I will worship with all of my heart! \\
I will praise you with all of my strength! \\
I will seek you all of my days, \\
I will follow all of your ways!

\begin{chorus}
    I will give you all my worship, \\
    I will give you all my praise! \\
    You alone I long to worship, \\
    You alone are worthy of my praise!
\end{chorus}

I will bow down, hail you as king. \\
I will serve You, give you everything. \\
I will lift up my eyes to your throne, \\
I will trust You, I will trust You alone!
\end{song}
