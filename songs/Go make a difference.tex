\songtitle{Go make a difference}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    Go make a difference. \\
    We can make a difference. \\    
    Go make a difference in the world. \\
    Go make a difference. \\
    We can make a difference. \\
    Go make a difference in the world.
\end{chorus}

We are the salt of the earth, \\
called to let the people see \\
the love of God in you and me. \\
We are the light of the world, \\
not to be hidden but be seen. \\
Go make a difference in the world.

We are the hands of Christ \\
reaching out to those in need, \\
the face of God for all to see. \\
We are the spirit of hope; \\
we are the voice of peace. \\
Go make a difference in the world.

So let your love shine on, \\
let it shine for all to see. \\
Go make a difference in the world. \\
And the spirit of Christ \\
will be with us as we go. \\
Go make a difference in the world.
\end{song}
