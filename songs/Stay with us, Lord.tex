\songtitle{Stay with us, Lord}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    Stay with us, Lord, leave us no more, \\
    see how our hearts are on fire with your word! \\
    You are the Bread broken for us, holy and Risen One!
\end{chorus}

Lamb of God, you carried our sin, \\
lifted high on the wood of the cross. \\
By your death you have conquered our death, \\
in your resurrection our life is restored!

Now a new creation has come; \\
gone forever the weight of our sin. \\
You have given this most precious gift: \\
you open forever new Eden for us!
\end{song}
