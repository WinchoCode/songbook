\songtitle{The Lord is my shepherd, nothing I shall want}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    The Lord is my shepherd, \\
    there’s nothing I shall want, \\
    He leads me to living waters.
\end{chorus}

Lord, your hand leads me to the rich grassy meadows. \\
By tranquil waters you will set me down. \\
In paths of righteousness your servant will follow, \\
befitting your name, God most holy.

If I should walk within a valley of darkness, \\
I fear no evil; you are by my side. \\
Your crook and staff Lord give me comfort and console me. \\
Protector and Shepherd, You guard my soul.

Lord, you prepare for me a banquet of plenty, \\
Yes, Lord, before the eyes of all my foes. \\
Lord, my head you anoint and my cup brims over. \\
With you by my side I shall never want.

Goodness and faithful love shall follow me always. \\
Yes, in your house I’ll live, O Lord, my God. \\
Day after day I praise the Lord, my Redeemer. \\
The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want.
\end{song}
