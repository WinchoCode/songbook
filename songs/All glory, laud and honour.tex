\songtitle{All Glory, Laud and Honour}
\begin{song}

All glory, laud, and honor \\
to you, Redeemer, King, \\
to whom the lips of children \\
made sweet hosannas ring. \\
You are the King of Israel \\
and David's royal Son, \\
now in the Lord's name coming, \\
the King and Blessed One.

The company of angels \\
is praising you on high; \\
and we with all creation \\
in chorus make reply. \\
The people of the Hebrews \\
with palms before you went; \\
our praise and prayer and anthems \\
before you we present.

To you before your passion \\
they sang their hymns of praise; \\
to you, now high exalted, \\
our melody we raise. \\
As you received their praises, \\
accept the prayers we bring, \\
for you delight in goodness, \\
O good and gracious King!
\end{song}
