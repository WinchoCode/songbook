\songtitle{Jesus, my Lord, my God, my All}
\begin{song}

Jesus, my Lord, my God, my All, \\
How can I love thee as I ought? \\
And how revere this wondrous gift, \\
So far surpassing hope or thought? \\
Sweet Sacrament, we thee adore; \\
Oh, make us love thee more and more. \\
Oh, make us love thee more and more.

2 Had I but Mary's sinless heart \\
To love thee with, my dearest King, \\
Oh, with what bursts of fervant praise \\
Thy goodness, Jesus, would I sing. \\
Sweet Sacrament, we thee adore; \\
Oh, make us love thee more and more. \\
Oh, make us love thee more and more.

3 Thy Body, Soul, and Godhead, all, \\
O mystery of love divine. \\
I cannot compass all I have, \\
For all thou hast and art are mine. \\
Sweet Sacrament, we thee adore; \\
Oh, make us love thee more and more. \\
Oh, make us love thee more and more.
