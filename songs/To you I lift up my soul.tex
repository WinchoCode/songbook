\songtitle{To you I lift up my soul}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    To you I lift up my soul, I open my heart, \\
    protect me, O Lord! \\
    I want ot trust in your love, to walk in your ways, \\
    O Lord, rescue me!
\end{chorus}

O Lord, the God of my life, \\
I search for your help, by day and by night. \\ 
Be near to me, o my Lord, \\ 
your merciful love is my only joy.

Remember me in your love. \\ 
Your goodness, O Lord, forever remains. \\ 
Forgive me all of my sins, \\
and guide me along the way of your truth.

Instruct me, Lord, in your word \\ 
and teach me to walk the path of your love. \\ 
A sinner, Lord, from my youth, \\ 
I trust in your goodness all of my days.

My soul is waiting on God, \\ 
O when shall I find the house of the Lord? \\ 
I lift my eyes up to Him, \\ 
for He is my hope, I shelter in Him.

Remove the load of my sin, \\ 
for I long to be renewed in your love. \\ 
Transform my heart with your grace, \\ 
O give me the joy of singing your praise.
\end{song}
