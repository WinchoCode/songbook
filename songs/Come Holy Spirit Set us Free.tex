\songtitle{Come Holy Spirit Set us Free}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    Come Holy Spirit set us free; \\
    Come Holy Spirit let us see; \\
    Come Holy Spirit, \\
    ever be here deep in our hearts.
\end{chorus}

You who proceed \\
from the Father and the Son, \\
O Spirit of all truth, \\
Instruct our minds. \\
Spirit of love, set our hearts on fire!

Water of life, \\
come to heal every wound, \\
O breath of God on high, \\
Give us your peace. \\
Fire of love, burn our sin away!

Spirit of peace, \\
cleanse our hearts of all grief; \\
O Spirit of all joy come sing in us. \\
Spirit of Life, give your life divine!
\end{song}
