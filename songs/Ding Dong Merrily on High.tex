\songtitle{Ding Dong Merrily on High}
\begin{song}

Ding dong merrily on high \\
In heav'n the bells are ringing: \\
Ding dong! Verily the sky \\
Is riv'n with angel singing

\begin{chorus}
    Gloria \\
    Hosanna in excelsis!
\end{chorus}

E'en so here below \\
Let steeple bells be swungen \\
And "Io, io, io!" \\
By priest and people sungen

Pray you dutifully prime \\
Your matin chime ye ringers \\
May you beautifully rime \\
Your eve'time song ye singers
\end{song}
