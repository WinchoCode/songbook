\songtitle{What the Lord has done in me}
\begin{song}

Let the weak say: “I am strong.” \\
Let the poor say: “I am rich.” \\
Let the blind say: “I can see. \\
It's what the Lord has done in me.”

\begin{chorus}
    Hosanna, Hosanna, \\
    to the Lamb that was slain. \\
    Hosanna, Hosanna, \\
    Jesus died and rose again.
\end{chorus}

Into the river I will wade. \\
There my sins are washed away. \\
From the heavens mercy streams \\
Of the Saviour's love for me.

I will rise from water’s deep \\
Into the saving arms of God. \\
I will sing salvations songs. \\
Jesus Christ has set me free.
\end{song}
