\songtitle{Jesus, He is the way}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    Jesus, He is the way, \\
    who leads to his Father above. \\
    He alone is our way and our truth; \\
    He is our life.
\end{chorus}

Never man spoke with such \\
words of wisdom as He, \\
never prophet could equal \\
the signs that we see; \\
God among us here!

John the Baptist proclaimed Him \\
the true Lamb of God, \\
now we walk in the paths \\
which his own feet have trod. \\
He is very near!

Those who trust in the Lord \\
and believe what they've heard, \\
walk no more in the dark \\
but find lite in his word. \\
Cast away your fear!

If you listen to me \\
and keep following me, \\
You will come to the truth, \\
and the truth sets you free. \\
I will soon appear!

If you love me. you must learn \\
to take up your cross, \\
but to lose life for me \\
is a gain not a loss. \\
Come and follow me!

I am king but my kingdom \\
is not of this earth, \\
for all those who believe in me, \\
come to new birth. \\
They belong to me!

He will come once again \\
to reward those He loves, \\
when we all will return \\
to our Father above. \\
To Him glory be!

From his side flowed the water \\
of life ever more, \\
and our lives witness now \\
the love which He bore. \\
Then our eyes will see!
