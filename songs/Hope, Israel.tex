\songtitle{Hope, Israel}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
Hope Israel, hope in the Lord your God \\
now and forever. (2x)
\end{chorus}

Humble is my heart before You, Lord. \\
I bow my head as I stand in your presence. \\
I do not seek for marvels beyound me!

Like a little child who is at rest, \\
who is content in the arms of its mother, \\
my soul is peaceful, it waits in silence.
\end{song}
