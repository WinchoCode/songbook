\songtitle{You saw me}
\begin{song}

Your glory fills the heavens, \\
Your glory fills the earth. \\
Still You chose surrrender, \\
You gave Yourself for me.

God of my salvation, \\
Hope of righteousness, \\
You paid the price of freedom, \\
You took a lonely cross.

I'll bless the Lord always, \\
bless Your holy Name …

\begin{chorus}
    And You saw me, \\
    when You took a crown of thorns \\
    and Your blood washed over me \\
    and You loved me \\
    through the nails that You bore … \\
    And Your blood washes over me.
\end{chorus}

Amazing like no other, \\
grace without an end. \\
As Your word had promised, \\
You died and rose again.

Bless the Lord always, \\
bless Your holy Name …
\end{song}
