\songtitle{Walk in the light}
\begin{song}

The Spirit lives to set us free, \\
walk, walk, in the light. \\
He binds us all in unity, \\
walk, walk, in the light.

\begin{chorus}
    Walk in the light, \\
    walk in the light, \\
    walk in the light, \\
    walk in the light of the Lord.
\end{chorus}

Jesus promised life to all, walk… \\
The dead were wakened by his call, walk…

He died in pain on Calvary, walk… \\
to save the lost like you and me, walk…

We know His death was not the end, walk… \\
He gave his Spirit to be our friend, walk…

By Jesus’ love our wounds are healed, walk… \\
The Father’s kindness is revealed, walk…

The Spirit lives in you and me, walk… \\
His light will shine for all to see, walk…
\end{song}
