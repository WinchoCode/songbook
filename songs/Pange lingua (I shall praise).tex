\songtitle{Pange lingua (I shall praise)}
\begin{song}

I shall praise the Savior's glory, \\
of His flesh the mystery sing, \\
and the blood, all price excelling, \\
shed by our immortal King; \\
God made man for our salvation, \\
Who from virgin pure did spring.

Born for us, and for us given, \\
born a man like us below, \\
Christ as man with man residing, \\
lived the seed of truth to sow, \\
suffered bitter death unflinching, \\
and immortal love did show.

On the night before He suffered, \\
seated with His chosen band, \\
Jesus, when they all had feasted, \\
faithful to the law's command, \\
far more precious food provided; \\
gave Himself with His own hand. 

Word made flesh, true bread of heaven \\
by His word made flesh to be; \\
from the wine His blood is taken, \\
though our senses cannot see; \\
faith alone which is unshaken \\
shows pure hearts the mystery.

Therefore we, before Him falling, \\
this great sacrament revere; \\
ancient forms are now departed, \\
for new acts of grace are here; \\
faith our feeble senses aiding, \\
makes the Savior's presence clear.

To the everlasting Father, \\
and to His Son Who reigns on high, \\
with the Holy Ghost proceeding \\
forth from each eternally, \\
be all honor, glory, blessing, \\
power and endless majesty. Amen.
