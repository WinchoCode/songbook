\songtitle{Immaculate Mary (Lourdes hymn)}
\begin{song}

Immaculate Mary, thy praises we sing; \\
thou reignest in splendor with Jesus our King.
\begin{chorus}
    Ave, ave, ave, Maria! Ave, ave, Maria! 
\end{chorus}

In heaven, the blessed thy glory proclaim; \\
On earth we, thy children, invoke thy fair name.

We pray for the Church, our true Mother on earth. \\
and beg thee to watch o´er the Land of our birth. 

Thy name is our power, thy virtues our light. \\
Thy love is our comfort, thy prayers our might.
\end{song}
