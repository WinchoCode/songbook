\songtitle{For You, o Lord}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    For you, o Lord, I sing my song of joy; \\
    how great You are, O my God! \\
    With all my heart \\
    I give You honour and thanks, \\
    I offer You endless praise.
\end{chorus}

See, I stand before You, Lord, \\
prepared to follow your way. \\
In your hand I put my trust, take me, Lord!

Lord, I lift my hands on high, \\
I praise your glorious name; \\
You have taught my lips to sing of your praise!

For your glory, Lord, is great, \\
and great your marvels for me; \\
by your light You have dispelled all my tears!

I will never cease to praise, \\
proclaim and honour You, Lord; \\
for your glory I will sing, holy Lord!
\end{song}
