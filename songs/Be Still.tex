\songtitle{Be Still}
\begin{song}

Be still, for the presence of the Lord, \\
the Holy One, is here. \\
Come, bow before him now \\
with reverence and fear. \\
In him no sin is found, \\
we stand on holy ground. \\
Be still, for the presence of the Lord, \\
the Holy One, is here.

Be still, for the glory of the Lord \\
is shining all around; \\
He burns with holy fire, \\
with splendor He is crowned. \\
How awesome is the sight, \\
our radiant King of light! \\
Be still, for the glory of the \\
Lord is shining all around.

Be still, for the power of the Lord \\
is moving in this place. \\
He comes to cleanse and heal, \\
to minister His grace, \\
No work too hard for him. \\
In faith receive from him. \\
Be still, for the power of the Lord \\
is moving in this place.
