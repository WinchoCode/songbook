\songtitle{May your kingdom come}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    May your kingdom come, \\
    may your name be always praised! \\
    here on earth as in heaven \\
    may your will be done today! \\
    The spirit of truth \\
    like a torrent power on us, \\
    pour your holiness on us, \\
    build our faith, our hope, our love!
\end{chorus}

Who could come between us Lord, \\
and the love that you have for us? \\
Who could turn away from You, \\
from your tenderness, O Lord?

In our praise you come to dwell. \\
You inspire us in our prayer. \\
Lord, you draw us near to you. \\
In your presence we are one.

(Bridge:) \\
From evil, Lord, set us free; \\
grant us your peace in our day! \\
Deliver us from our sin; \\
show us your mercy and grace! \\
Protect us, Lord, from all fear; \\
We wait in joy and in hope! \\
Your reign on earth is at hand: \\
the coming of Jesus Christ.

So the Lord will be our light \\
and dispel the night forever. \\
On our lips will be his name \\
and our tears will be no more.
\end{song}
