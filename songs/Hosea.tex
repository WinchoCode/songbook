\songtitle{Hosea}
\begin{song}

Come back to me with all your heart \\
don't let fear keep us apart \\
Trees do bend though straight and tall \\
so must we to others' call.

\begin{chorus}
    Long have I waited for your coming \\
    home to me and living deeply our new life.
\end{chorus}

The wilderness will lead you \\
to your heart where I will speak \\
Integrity and justice \\
with tenderness you shall know

You shall sleep secure with peace \\
faithfulness will be your joy.
\end{song}
