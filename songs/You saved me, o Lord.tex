\songtitle{You saved me, o Lord}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    You saved me, O Lord, alleluia, \\
    In you, I am free, alleluia. \\
    We praise You, O God, alleluia. \\
    Give glory to you, alleluia.
\end{chorus}

By your cross, you set us free \\
from the pow’r of sin and death, \\
from the darkness of the tomb, \\
into your glorious light.

With your Spirit in our heart, \\
we may live in you, O Lord. \\
You send us into the world, \\
to proclaim the good news.

Lord, your light dispelled the night, \\
for you came to heal our wounds. \\
You turn sadness into joy, \\
from despair, hope can spring!
\end{song}
