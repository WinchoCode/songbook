\songtitle{The Power of Your Love}
\begin{song}

Lord, I come to You, \\
let my heart be changed, renewed, \\
Flowing from the grace, \\
that I've found in You. \\
And, Lord, I've come to know \\
the weaknesses I see in me \\
will be stripped away \\
by the power of Your love.

\begin{chorus}
    Hold me close, let your love surround me. \\
    Bring me near, draw me to your side. \\
    And as I wait I'll rise up like the eagle \\
    and I will soar with You, your Spirit leads me on \\
    in the power of Your love.
\end{chorus}

Lord unveil my eyes, \\
let me see You face to face, \\
the knowledge of your love \\
as you live in me. \\
Lord renew my mind \\
as your will unfolds in my life \\
in living everyday \\
by the power of your love.
\end{song}
