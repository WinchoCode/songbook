\songtitle{Father I have sinned}
\begin{song}

Father, I have sinned, \\
help me find my way, \\
remember not my sins, \\
just let me hear You say:

\begin{chorus}
    I forgive you, I love you. \\
    You are mine, take my hand. \\
    Go in peace, sin no more, \\
    beloved one.
\end{chorus}

Father, I have turned \\
my back and walked away, \\
depended on my strength, \\
and lived life my own way.

Father I have closed \\
my heart to those in need, \\
thought only of myself, \\
a victim of my greed.

Father I’ve returned, \\
I’m home with You to stay, \\
standing by your door, \\
knowing that You’ll say:
\end{song}
