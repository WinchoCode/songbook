\songtitle{Let all creation}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    Let all creation rejoice \\
    and may the glory of God \\
    shine out throughout the world \\
    All dance together with joy \\
    the heavens, all of the earth \\
    sing alleluia
\end{chorus}

Out of love for us all \\
God’s light shines in the world \\
Light transforming the hearts \\
of all those who welcome His love

You who lived in the night \\
now it’s time to rejoice \\
Jesus gives you new life \\
He became a man just like us

May the world come to know: \\
Jesus Christ is our King \\
Let’s cast off all despair \\
for a life of joy without end

Jesus Christ, You’re our Lord \\
Send the Spirit of Love \\
Come and reign in our hearts \\
May Your Kingdom come, O Lord, God
\end{song}
