\songtitle{Christ the Lord is risen today}
\begin{song}

Christ the Lord is risen today, Alleluia! \\
Sons of men and angels say, Alleluia! \\
Raise your joys and triumphs high, Alleluia! \\
Sing, ye heav’ns, and earth, reply, Alleluia!

Vain the stone, the watch, the seal, Alleluia! \\
Christ has burst the gates of hell, Alleluia! \\
Death in vain forbids his rise, Alleluia! \\
Christ has opened paradise, Alleluia!

Lives again our glorious King, Alleluia! \\
Where, O death, is now thy sting? Alleluia! \\
Once He died our souls to save, Alleluia! \\
Where thy victory, O grave? Alleluia!

Soar we now where Christ hath led, Alleluia! \\
Foll’wing our exalted Head, Alleluia! \\
Made like Him, like Him we rise, Alleluia! \\
Ours the cross, the grave, the skies, Alleluia!
