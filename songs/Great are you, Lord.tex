\songtitle{Great are you, Lord}
\begin{song}

You give life, You are love, \\
You bring light to the darkness. \\
You give hope, You restore ev'ry heart \\
that is broken. \\
And great are You, Lord!

It's Your breath in our lungs, \\
so we pour out our praise, \\
we pour out our praise! \\
It's Your breath in our lungs, \\
so we pour out our praise to You only.

And all the earth will shout your praise, \\
our hearts will cry, these bones will sing, \\
great are you Lord!
\end{song}
