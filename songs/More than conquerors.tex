\songtitle{More than conquerors}
\begin{song}

When my hope and strength is gone, \\
You're the one who calls me on, \\
You are the life, You are the fight \\
that's in my soul.

Oh, Your resurrection power \\
burns like fire in my heart. \\
When waters rise, I lift my eyes \\
up to Your throne.

\begin{chorus}
    We are more than conquerors, through Christ. \\
    You have overcome this world, this life. \\
    We will not bow to sin or to shame, \\
    we are defiant in Your name, \\
    You are the fire, that cannot be tamed, \\
    You are the power in our veins, \\
    Our Lord, our God, our Conqueror!
\end{chorus}

I will sing into the night, \\
Christ is risen and on high, \\
Greater is He, living in me, \\
than in the world.

No surrender, no retreat, \\
we are free and we're redeemed. \\
We will declare over despair: \\
You are the hope.

(Bridge) \\
Nothing is impossible, \\
every chain is breakable. \\
With You, we are victorious. \\
You are stronger than our hearts, \\
You are greater than the dark, \\
With You, we are victorious! (3x)
\end{song}
