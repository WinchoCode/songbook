\songtitle{You are my all in all}
\begin{song}

You are my strength, when I am weak. \\
You are the treasure that I seek. \\
You are my all in all. \\
Seeking You as a precious jewel, \\
Lord, to give up I'd be a fool, \\
You are my all in all.

\begin{chorus}
    Jesus, Lamb of God, \\
    worthy is your name! (repeat)
\end{chorus}

Taking my sins, my cross, my shame, \\
rising again, I bless your name. \\
You are my all in all. \\
When I fall down, You pick me up. \\
When I am dry, You fill my cup. \\
You are my all in all.
\end{song}
