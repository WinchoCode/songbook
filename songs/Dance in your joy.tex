\songtitle{Dance in your joy}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
Dance in your joy, dance before your God, \\
Dance in a round of endless love. (2x)
\end{chorus}

Dance for the Lord as David danced, \\
Dance for the ark of God; \\
He has returned to dwell with us, \\
We are his own again.

Sing to the Lord as Mary sang, \\
Give praise, rejoice in God; \\
Faithful his love in ages past, \\
Now and for evermore.

Angels gave praise at Bethlehem, \\
Peace to all men on earth, \\
We, like the shepherds, see his works, \\
Glory to God on high.
\end{song}
