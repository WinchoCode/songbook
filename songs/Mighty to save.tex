\songtitle{Mighty to save}
\begin{song}

Everyone needs compassion, \\
a love that's never failing, \\
let mercy fall on me. \\
Everyone needs forgiveness, \\
a kindness of a Savior, \\
the hope of nations!

\begin{chorus}
    Savior, He can move the mountains, \\
    my God is mighty to save, \\
    He is mighty to save! \\
    Forever Author of salvation, \\
    He rose and conquered the grave, \\
    Jesus conquered the grave!
\end{chorus}

So take me as You find me, \\
all my fears and failures, \\
fill my life again! \\
I give my life to follow \\
everything I believe in, \\
now I surrender!

Shine your light and \\
let the whole world see \\
we're singing \\
for the glory \\
of the risen King... Jesus! (repeat)
\end{song}
