\songtitle{Ave Maria, I kneel before you}
\begin{song}

As I kneel before you, \\
as I bow my head in prayer, \\
take this day, make it yours \\
and fill me with your love!
\begin{chorus}
    Ave Maria, gratia plena, \\
    Dominus tecum, benedicta tu!
\end{chorus}

All I have I give you \\
every dream and wish are yours! \\
Mother of Christ, Mother of mine, \\
present them to my Lord!

As I kneel before you \\
and I see your smiling face, \\
every thought, every word \\
is lost in your embrace!
\end{song}
