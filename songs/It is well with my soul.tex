\songtitle{It is well with my soul}
\begin{song}

When peace like a river attendeth my way \\
When sorrows like sea billows roll \\
Whatever my lot Thou hast taught me to say \\
It is well, it is well with my soul

\begin{chorus}
    It is well with my soul, \\
    it is well, \\
    it is well with my soul
\end{chorus}

My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought! \\
My sin, not in part but the whole \\
is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more. \\
Praise the Lord praise the Lord, O my soul! \\
For me, be it Christ be it Christ hence to live. \\
If Jordan above me shall roll \\
no pang shall be mine for in death as in life, \\
Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.

But Lord, 'tis for Thee for Thy coming we wait \\
The sky, not the grave, is our goal. \\
Oh, trump of the angel! Oh, voice of the Lord! \\
Blessed hope blessed rest of my soul.

And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight \\
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll \\
The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend \\
Even so it is well with my soul.
\end{song}
