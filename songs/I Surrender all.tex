\songtitle{I Surrender all}
\begin{song}

All to Jesus I surrender \\
all to Him I freely give \\
I will ever love and trust Him \\
in His presence daily live.

\begin{chorus}
    I surrender all, I surrender \\
    all all to You my blessed Savior \\
    I surrender all
\end{chorus}

All to Jesus I surrender \\
Make me Savior wholy Thine \\
Let me feel the Holy Spirit \\
Truly know that You are mine.

All to Jesus I surrender \\
Lord, I give myself to Thee \\
Fill me with your love and power \\
Let Your blessing fall on me.
\end{song}
