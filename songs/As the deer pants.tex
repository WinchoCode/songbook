\songtitle{As the deer pants}
\begin{song}

As the deer panteth for the water, \\
so my soul longeth after thee. \\
You alone are my heart’s desire \\
and I long to worship thee.

\begin{chorus}
    You alone are my strength, my shield, \\
    to You alone may my spirit yield. \\
    You alone are my heart’s desire \\
    and I long to worship thee.
\end{chorus}

You’re my friend and You are my brother, \\
even though You are a King. \\
I love You more than any other, \\
so much more than anything.

I want You more than gold or silver, \\
only You can satisfy. \\
You alone are the real joy giver \\
and the apple of my eye.
\end{song}
