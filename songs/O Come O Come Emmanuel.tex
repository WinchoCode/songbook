\songtitle{O Come O Come Emmanuel}
\begin{song}

O come, O come, Emmanuel \\
and ransom captive Israel \\
that mourns in lonely exile here \\
until the Son of God appear.

\begin{chorus}
    Rejoice! Rejoice! \\
    Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel!
\end{chorus}

O come, Thou Dayspring, come and cheer \\ 
our spirits by Thine advent here. \\
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night \\
and death's dark shadows put to flight.

O come, O Branch of Jesse's stem \\
unto Your own and rescue them! \\
From depths of hell Your people save \\
and give them victory o'er the grave.

O come, desire of nations, bind \\
in one the hearts of all mankind. \\
Bid thou our sad divisions cease \\
and be Thyself our King of Peace.

O come, O Key of David, come \\
and open wide our heavenly home \\
Make safe for us the heavenward road \\
and bar the way to death's abode.

O come, O Bright and Morning Star \\
and bring us comfort from afar! \\
Dispel the shadows of the night \\
and turn our darkness into light.


\end{song}
