\songtitle{O Come O Come Emmanuel}
\begin{song}

O come, O come, Emmanuel \\
and ransom captive Israel \\
that mourns in lonely exile here \\
until the Son of God appear.

\begin{chorus}
    Rejoice! Rejoice! \\
    Emmanuel shall come to you, O Israel!
\end{chorus}

O come, O Wisdom from on high \\
who ordered all things mightily \\
to us the path of knowledge show \\
and teach us in its ways to go.

O come, O come great Lord of might, \\
who to Your tribes on Sinai's height \\
in ancient times did give the law \\
in cloud and majesty and awe.

O come, O Branch of Jesse's stem \\
unto Your own and rescue them! \\
From depths of hell Your people save \\
and give them victory o'er the grave

O come, O Key of David, come \\
and open wide our heavenly home \\
Make safe for us the heavenward road \\
and bar the way to death's abode.

O come, O Bright and Morning Star \\
and bring us comfort from afar! \\
Dispel the shadows of the night \\
and turn our darkness into light.

O come, O King of nations, \\
bind in one the hearts of all mankind \\
Bid all our sad divisions cease \\
and be yourself our King of Peace
\end{song}
