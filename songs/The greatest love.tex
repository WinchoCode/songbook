\songtitle{The greatest love}
\begin{song}

A new dawn in coming near, \\
the harvest calls loud and clear. \\
Who is the one who´ll give you might \\
to bear his fruits and stand upright? (2x)

\begin{chorus}
    The greatest love is calling you, \\
    to lift your spirit high! \\
    The greatest love is calling you, \\
    to eternal spring of life.
\end{chorus}

(Bridge:)
Take my peace if you are weary, come. \\
Tired and thirsty, come. \\
Just open up your heart to me! (4x)
\end{song}
