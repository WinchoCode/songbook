\songtitle{Blessed are you, Lord}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
Blessed are you, Lord, God, the Father of creation. \\
Blessed are you, Lord, glory be to your name. \\
Blessed are you, Lord, source of life and love eternal. \\
Blessed are you, Lord, through Je-sus Christ.
\end{chorus}

We offer you, Father, this bread and this wine. \\
These gifts of creation, we offer on your altar. \\
Accept our sacrifice, grant us your blessing, Lord, \\
So that salvation comes for the life of the world.

We offer you, Father, the gift of our lives. \\
By the pow’r of your Spirit, transform our hearts with fire. \\
Accept our sacrifice, grant us your blessing, Lord, \\
So that salvation comes for the life of the world.

Be blessed now and forevermore, \\
Be blessed now and forevermore, \\
Be blessed now and forevermore, our Lord and God.
\end{song}
