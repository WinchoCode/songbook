\songtitle{God will make a way}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    God will make a way, \\
    where there seems to be no way. \\
    He works in ways we cannot see, \\
    He will make a way for me. \\
    He will be my guide, \\
    hold me closely to His side. \\
    With love and strength \\
    for each new day \\
    He will make a way!	(2x)
\end{chorus}

By the roadway in the wilderness \\
He’ll lead me. \\
And rivers in the dessert will I see. \\
Heaven and earth will fade \\
but his word will still remain. \\
He will do something new today.
\end{song}
