\songtitle{I come to You}
\begin{song}

Just as the clay shaped upon the wheel, \\
By potters hands who form and work the clay, \\
So is my soul moulded by the Lord, \\
So does my heart, seek You alone my God.

\begin{chorus}
    I come to You, Jesus. I come to You, Jesus my Lord! (2x)
\end{chorus}

Just as the land parched in need of rain, \\
So does my heart so thirst for You my God. \\
You are the source, wellspring of all life, \\
He who believes in You will never thirst.

Just as a watchman awaits the dawn, \\
So does my soul hope only in your word. \\
O Lord, your word is a lamp for me, \\
A light to guide me on the way to life.
\end{song}
