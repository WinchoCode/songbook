\songtitle{Never weather-beaten sail}
\begin{song}
Never weather-beaten sail more willing bent to shore. \\
Never tired pilgrim's limbs affected slumber more, \\
Than my wearied sprite now longs \\
to fly out of my troubled breast: \\
O come quickly, o come quickly, sweetest Lord, \\ 
and take my soul to rest.

Ever blooming are the joys of Heaven's high Paradise. \\
Cold age deafs not there our ears nor vapour dims our eyes: \\
Glory there the sun outshines \\
whose beams the blessed only see:\\
O come quickly, o come quickly, glorious Lord, \\ 
and raise my sprite to thee!
\end{song}
