\songtitle{Come, magnify the Lord with me}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    Come, magnify the Lord with me, \\
    come, praise his holy name. \\
    He does amazing things for me \\
    and for you he does the same.
\end{chorus}

For he looks up on his servant in her lowliness. \\
From now on all generations call me greatly blessed!

The mighty God works marvels for me, \\
holy is his name. \\
His mercy for all who fear him, \\
lasts from age to age!

He stretches out his mighty arm \\
and scatters the proud of heart. \\
He pulls down princes from their thrones \\
and lifts the lowly up, high up.

He fills the starving with good things, \\
send the rich, empty away. \\
To Israel he is protector, \\
remembering his mercy!
\end{song}
