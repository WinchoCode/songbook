\songtitle{Only by grace (All my being)}
\begin{song}

All my being searches, \\
from where will my help come? \\
From my Lord and Saviour, \\
the Father’s only Son. \\
In all my distresses, \\
He comes to set me free. \\
He is ever faithful, \\
for all eternity.

\begin{chorus}
Only by grace, \\
can I approach your holy throne. \\
Only by grace, \\
can I be welcomed home. \\
You paid the price, \\
a new creation comes to be. \\
Through your rising from the dead, \\
You set your people free.
\end{chorus}

You know all my thoughts, Lord, \\
and You know all my fears. \\
Even from the womb, Lord, \\
yes, You were always near. \\
You forgive the sinner, \\
unbounded love you give. \\
Wonderful your mercy, \\
in your light I shall live.
\end{song}
