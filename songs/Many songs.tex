\songtitle{Many songs}
\begin{song}

Many hearts, many gifts \\
gathered into one: \\
called to be Christ (x3) \\
and serve each other‘s needs.

Many minds, many gifts \\
gathered into one: \\
called to be Christ (x3) \\
and nourished by this word.

Many lives, many gifts \\
gathered into one: \\
called to be Christ	(x3) \\
in wonder, love and praise.

Many hearts, many gifts \\
going forth as one: \\
called to be Christ	(x3) \\
to change a thirsting world.
\end{song}
