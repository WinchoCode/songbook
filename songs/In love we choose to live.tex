\songtitle{In love we choose to live}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    Love is patient, love is kind. \\
    Love is ready to forgive. \\
    In our love new hope is found. \\
    In love we choose to live.
\end{chorus}

May love be our home; rest to soothe tired bones. \\
May love be healing for our wounds. \\
May love speak the truth; free us from our fear. \\
May love be the heart of our anger!

May love be the sun shining in our darkness. \\
May love fill the lives of our children. \\
May love be our strength, to live a life of justice. \\
May love be our call to live the Kingdom!
\end{song}
