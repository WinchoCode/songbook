\songtitle{Jesus, You call me, Lord}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    Jesus, You call me, Lord, \\
    Jesus, to be with You. \\
    You look at me with love. \\
    Your love transforms my life. \\
    Jesus, I come to You.
\end{chorus}

Your holy word my God is light upon my path; \\
I am your servant Lord, \\
You are my hope and strength.

My worries, my concerns, \\
I give them all to You. \\
Good Shepherd of my soul, \\
O I adore You, Lord.

O Lord, I am so poor and yet, \\
You care for me, \\
My Saviour Lord, my God, \\
without You I am lost.
\end{song}
