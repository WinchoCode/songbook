\songtitle{Go tell everyone}
\begin{song}

God's Spirit is in my heart, \\
He has called me and set me apart. \\
This is what I have to do, \\
what I have to do.

\begin{chorus}
    He sent me to give \\
    the Good News to the poor; \\
    tell pris’ners \\
    that they are pris’ners no more, \\
    tell blind people that they can see \\
    and set the downtrodden free, \\
    and go tell ev'ryone \\
    the news that the kingdom of God has come, \\
    and go tell ev'ryone \\
    the news that God's kingdom has come.
\end{chorus}

Just as the Father sent me, \\
so I'm sending you out to be \\
my witnesses throughout the world, \\
the whole of the world.

Don't worry what you have to say \\
don't worry because on that day \\
God's spirit will speak in your heart, \\
will speak in your heart.
\end{song}
