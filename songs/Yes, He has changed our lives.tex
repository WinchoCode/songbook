\songtitle{Yes, He has changed our lives}
\begin{song}

    \begin{chorus}
    Yes, He has changed our lives, \\
    yes, He has changed our hearts, \\
    He is alive, alleluia! (2x)
\end{chorus}

Jesus gives us His light to use it, \\
not to hide it away from view. \\
Let us teach all the world to choose it, \\
let us tell of His love anew!

On the people who walked in darkness \\
now a marvelous light has dawned. \\
For a world, full of fear and sadness, \\
now a saviour and king is born!

Jesus calls everyone His brother, \\
by the light of His love we see. \\
He alone is our God, none other \\
could reddeem us and set us free!

Jesus sends us to withess for him, \\
to make known to the world His call. \\
to enflame people to adore Him, \\
to proclaim the Good News to all!
\end{song}
