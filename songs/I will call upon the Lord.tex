\begin{song}

I will call upon the Lord, \\
who is worthy to be praised. \\
So shall I be saved from my enemies!

\begin{chorus}
    The Lord liveth and blessed be my rock
    and let the God of my salvation be exalted!
    The Lord liveth and blessed be my rock
    and let the God of my salvation be exalted!
\end{chorus}
