\songtitle{Awesome God}
\begin{song}

When He rolls up His sleeves \\
He ain't just putting on the ritz. \\
(Our God is an awesome God!) \\
There's thunder in His footsteps \\
and lightning in His fists. \\
(Our God is an awesome God!)

And the Lord wasn't joking \\
when He kicked 'em out of Eden. \\
It wasn't for no reason \\
that He shed His blood. \\
His return is very close \\
and so you better be believing that \\
our God is an awesome God!

\begin{chorus}
    Our God is an awesome God, \\
    He reigns from heaven above \\
    with wisdom, power, and love, \\
    our God is an awesome God.
\end{chorus}

And when the sky was starless \\
in the void of the night, \\
(Our God is an awesome God!) \\
He spoke into the darkness \\
and created the light. \\
(Our God is an awesome God!)

Judgement and wrath \\
He poured out on Sodom, \\
mercy and grace \\
He gave us at the cross. \\
I hope that we have not \\
too quickly forgotten that \\
our God is an awesome God.
