\songtitle{Shine out and arise}
\begin{song}

Shine out and arise for your light has come, \\
God’s own glory risen now upon you. (x2) \\
Through the nations still are in darkness now, \\
Kings will hasten to the brightness of your light; \\
Bringing richest gifts from their lands to you \\
Singing praises to the Lord of Hosts.

\begin{chorus}
    Jerusalem, Jerusalem, cast off your sadness \\
    and your mourning, \\
    Jerusalem, Jerusalem, dance and sing before \\
    your God.
\end{chorus}

Who are these you see flying like a cloud? \\
Like the doves returning to their home. (x2) \\
From the distant isles all your people come, \\
Now the ships of Tarshish come to bring them home, \\
See your sons assembling from far away, \\
Children gently carried in their arms.
\end{song}
