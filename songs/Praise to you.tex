\begin{chorus}
Praise to you, let me sing of your love, \\
Spirit of fire, my Lord! \\
Glory to You, the world is full of your light: \\

Spirit, come! Pour out your rays of light, \\
let them fill me with your love. \\
Come to me, come quickly, come visit my soul; \\
Spirit, come, enter my heart!

Spirit, come! Precious gift from on high, \\
come, console me with your love! \\
Come and cure the wounds of my sole, \\
heal me Lord, Spirit, come, enter my heart!

Spirit, come! Wash away all my fears, \\
fill me with new life in you. \\
Clear the path before me, \\
keep me from all sin, \\
Spirit, come, enter my heart!

Spirit, come! Holy fire from above, \\
come and change my heart of stone! \\
Make it burn with love for You, Spirit of truth, \\
Spirit, come, enter my heart!

Spirit, come! Come and give me your peace, \\
take my life, set me ablaze. \\
Fill me with your joy, let me sing to your name, \\
Spirit, come, enter my heart!
