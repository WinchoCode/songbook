\songtitle{With one voice}
\begin{song}

Take the Word and go out to ev'ry land: \\
shine the light of Christ for all to see! \\
May the lives of those we touch \\
sing praise to God above. \\
Let us sing, we'll sing:

\begin{chorus}
    With one voice we'll pass the Word along; \\
    with one voice, bring justice to the world. \\
    And with all the angels \\
    we'll spread the goodness of God. \\
    With all power and glory \\
    the Word of God shall reign.
\end{chorus}

Take the Word to our neighborhoods and streets: \\
shine the light of Christ for all to see! \\
May we all set out to live \\
in peace and harmony. \\
They will see and sing:

Take the Word to the people in despair: \\
shine the light of Christ for all to see! \\
May our actions and our deeds \\
bring comfort to their needs. \\
And they'll know and sing:

Take the Word to the nations ev'rywhere: \\
shine the light of Christ for all to see! \\
May the witness of our lives \\
transform the world anew. \\
And we'll shine, we'll shine:
\end{song}
