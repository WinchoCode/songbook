\songtitle{Trading My Sorrows}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    I’m trading my sorrows, \\
    I’m trading my shame, \\
    I’m laying them down for the joy of the Lord!

    I’m trading my sickness, \\
    I’m trading my pain, \\
    I’m laying them down for the joy of the Lord!
\end{chorus}

Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord! \\
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord! \\
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord, Amen!

I am pressed, but not crushed, \\
persecuted, not abandoned. \\
Struck down, but not destroyed. \\
I am blessed beyond the curse \\
for His promise will endure, \\
that his joy’s gonna be my strength. \\
Though the sorrow may last for the night, \\
His joy comes with the morning!
\end{song}
