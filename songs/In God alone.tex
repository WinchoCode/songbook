\songtitle{In God alone}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    In God alone my heart rests secure, \\
    from Him come my safety and help, \\
    for He is my rock, He alone my joy and strength; \\
    in his shelter I stand unshaken. \\
    In God alone my heart rests secure, \\
    from Him come my safety and help, \\
    for He is my rock, He alone my joy and strength; \\
    I know I can depend on his love.
\end{chorus}

Trust in Him, o people of God always. \\
Pour out your hearts to Him now; \\
for our God is strong to save us, \\
He bears our troubles for us; \\
our rock our mighty fortress; \\
He is all our hope.

My people put no faith in this world's goods, \\
set your hearts free of its wealth. \\
For with God it counts for nothing, \\
A feather on the balance: \\
Yes, God knows all our longings; \\
he provides for all.
\end{song}
