\songtitle{Lord, make me a mountain}
\begin{song}

Lord, make me a mountain, \\
standing tall for You. \\
Lord, make me a fountain \\
of water clear and new. \\
Lord make me a river \\
of water pure and sweet. \\
Lord, make me the servant \\
of ev'ryone I meet.

Lord, make me a candle, \\
shining with your light: \\
steadfastly, unflickering, \\
standing for the right. \\
Lord, make me a fire, \\
burning strong for You. \\
Lord, make me be humble \\
in ev'rything I do.

Lord, make me a mountain, \\
standing tall for You: \\
strong and free and holy, \\
in everything I do. \\
Lord, make me a shepherd, \\
that I may feed your sheep. \\
Lord, make me the servant of ev'ryone I meet.
