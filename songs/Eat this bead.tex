\songtitle{Eat this bead}
\begin{song}

Eat this bread, drink this cup, \\
come to Him and never be hungry. \\
Eat this bread, drink this cup, \\
trust in him and you will not thirst.

Jesus Christ, bread of life, \\
those who come to you \\
will not hunger. \\
Jesus Christ, risen Lord, \\
those who trust in you will not thirst. \\
The Lord is my shepherd
