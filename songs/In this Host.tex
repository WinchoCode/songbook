\songtitle{In this Host}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
In this Host, receive Christ the Saviour, \\
God concealed in form of Bread.
Blessed servants of the living Lord, \\
rest only on his heart, learn everything from him.
\end{chorus}

Behold, beloved of the Father, \\
Son, he has given up to save the world; \\
in our midst, he became a men like us, \\
Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God.

In love, you took our human weakness, \\
took the condition of a slave for us; \\
King of kings, but you knelt before your servants, \\
to wash the feet of men.

How great this mystery, o Master, \\
how may my heart recieve your endless love? \\
though i sin in my body and my soul, \\
you have come to dwell in me.

On you alone my hope is founded, \\
wash not my feet alone, but cleanse my soul. \\
froum your heart pour the Spirit on my dryness, \\
the water of new life.

You call me, Lord, to be your servant, \\
yet in my weakness I depend on you. \\
May my heart be a dwelling place for you, \\
ever burning with your love.
