\songtitle{Face to face}
\begin{song}

Face to face with Christ, my Savior, \\
face to face – what will it be? \\
When with rapture I behold him, \\
Jesus Christ, who died for me?

\begin{chorus}
    Face to face I shall behold him, \\
    far beyond the starry sky; \\
    face to face in all his glory, \\
    I shall see him by and by.
\end{chorus}

Only faintly now I see him, \\
with the darkling veil between, \\
but a blessed day is coming, \\
when his glory shall be seen.

What rejoicing in his presence, \\
when are banished grief and pain; \\
when the crooked ways are straightened \\
and the dark things shall be plain.

Face to face – o, blissful moment! \\
Face to face – to see and know; \\
face to face with my Redeemer, \\
Jesus Christ, who loves me so.
\end{song}
