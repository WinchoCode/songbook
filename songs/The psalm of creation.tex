\songtitle{The psalm of creation}
\begin{song}

Through the heavens above, \\
in splendor and might, \\
through the vast and the small, \\
through the day, through the night, \\
through the stars that You weave \\
in Your radiant sky, \\
through the warmth of the sun…

\begin{chorus}
    I cry out, O my God! \\
    You are great, You are bright, \\
    Living God, God of light, \\
    You are God, full of love! \\
    O God! You are great, You are bright, \\
    living God, God of light, \\
    ever present in all You have made.
\end{chorus}

Through the depths of the sea \\
and the waves on the shore, \\
through the lands far and wide, \\
through the rivers that pour, \\
through the fire that proclaims, \\
like a bush set ablaze, \\
through the whispering winds…

Through the hills and the plains, \\
through the valleys so deep, \\
through the shade of the woods, \\
through the flowers that speak, \\
through the buds on the trees \\
and the grass in the fields, \\
through the ripening wheat…

Through the beasts of the land, \\
through the fish in the sea, \\
through the song of the birds, \\
through the breath that sets free, \\
through the one You have shaped \\
just a step beneath You, \\
through the child’s gentle hands…

Through the hands that reach out, \\
inviting to dance, \\
through the kiss that is born \\
of a hope’s second chance, \\
through the eyes filled with love, \\
lifting hearts from the cold, \\
through the bread and the wine…
\end{song}
