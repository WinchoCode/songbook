\songtitle{Ave Maria, we call unto you}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    Ave Maria, we call unto you, \\
    You are full of grace and the Lord is with you.
\end{chorus}

O Mother Mary, take us by the hand. \\
Make us true disciples of the Son of Man.

Image of love, you trusted what you heard. \\
Chosen by the Father, you fulfilled his word.

You heard his promise spoken from above; \\
kept your eyes upon Him, trusting in his love.

Hope of believers, don’t leave us alone; \\
intercede for us before the Father’s throne.

In grief our Mother, in despair our friend; \\
help us know your Son, on whom our lives depend.
\end{song}
