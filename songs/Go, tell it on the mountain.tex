\songtitle{Go, tell it on the mountain}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    Go, tell it on the mountain, \\
    over the hills and everywhere, \\
    go, tell it on the mountain, \\
    that Jesus Christ is born!
\end{chorus}

While shepherds kept their watching \\
o'er silent flocks by night, \\
behold throughout the heavens \\
there shone a Holy light!

The shepherds feared and trembled, \\
when, lo! Above the Earth \\
rang out the angel chorus, \\
that hailed our Savior's birth!

Down in a lowly manger \\
our humble Christ was born \\
and brought us all salvation, \\
that blessed Christmas morn!
\end{song}
