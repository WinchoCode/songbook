\songtitle{Mary’s Song}
\begin{song}

My soul magnifies the Lord, \\
my spirit sings to God, my saviour. \\
For He has seen my low estate, \\
and on His servant shown His favour.

\begin{chorus}
    Behold, I am forever blessed! \\
    Mighty God has done great things for me! \\
    His mercy in every age \\
    extends to those, who fear his Holy name.
\end{chorus}

God has shown strength with his arm, \\
scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts. \\
Removed the mighty from their thrones, \\
and exalted those of humble abode.

God has been good to Israel, \\
in remembrance of His mercy. \\
Just as he spoke to Abraham, \\
and to his children for Eternity.
\end{song}
