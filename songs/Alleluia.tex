    Alle, alleluia! (4x)
\end{chorus}

Wonderful the ways you show us, O lord. \\
You are God Almighty ruler of all. \\
You are just in all you decree.

Who could stand against You, \\
God of all might? \\
Who could overcome the power of your name? \\
You have shown your greatness to all.

Nations all will come to offer their praise, \\
Worship and adore your presence divine; \\
You have shown your power to all.
