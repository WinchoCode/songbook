\songtitle{You are Holy (Prince of Peace)}
\begin{song}

You are holy, \\
You are mighty, \\
You are worthy, \\
Worthy of praise! \\
I will follow, \\
I will listen, \\
I will love You, \\
All of my days!

I will sing to and worship \\
the King who is worthy, \\
I will love and adore Him \\
and I will bow down before Him! \\
And I will sing to and worship \\
the King who is worthy, \\
and I will love and adore Him \\
and I will bow down before Him; \\
You're my Prince of Peace and I will live my life for You!

(You are Lord of Lords, You are King of Kings, \\
You are Mighty God, Lord of everything, \\
You're Emmanuel, You're the Great 'I Am', \\
You're the Prince of Peace, who is the Lamb, \\
You're my living God, You're my saving grace, \\
You will reign forever, You are ancient of days, \\
You're the Alpha, Omega, beginning and end, \\
You're my Savior, Messiah, Redeemer, and Friend, \\
You're my Prince of Peace and I will live my life for You!)
