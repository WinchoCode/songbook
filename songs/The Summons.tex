\songtitle{The Summons}
\begin{song}

Will you come and follow me \\
If I but call your name? \\
Will you go where you don’t know \\
And never be the same? \\
Will you let my love be shown? \\
Will you let my name be known? \\
Will you let my life be grown \\
In you and you in me?

Will you leave yourself behind \\
If I but call your name? \\
Will you care for cruel and kind \\
And never be the same? \\
Will you risk the hostile stare \\
Should your life attract or scare? \\
Will you let me answer pray’r \\
In you and you in me?

Will you let the blinded see \\
If I but call your name? \\
Will you set the pris’ners free \\
And never be the same? \\
Will you kiss the leper clean, \\
And do such as this unseen, \\
And admit to what I mean \\
In you and you in me?

Will you love the ‘you’ you hide \\
If I but call your name? \\
Will you quell the fear inside \\
And never be the same? \\
Will you use the faith you’ve found \\
To reshape the world around, \\
Through my sight and touch and sound \\
In you and you in me?
