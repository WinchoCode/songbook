\songtitle{Here I am to worship}
\begin{song}

Light of the world, \\
You stepped down into darkness, \\
opened my eyes, let me see. \\
Beauty that made this heart adore You, \\
hope of a life spent with You.

\begin{chorus}
Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down, \\
here I am to say that You're my God. \\
You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy, \\
altogether wonderful to me.
\end{chorus}

King of all days, oh so highly exalted, \\
glorious in heaven above. \\
Humbly You came to the earth \\
You created All for love's sake became poor.

(Bridge) \\
I'll never know, \\
how much it cost \\
to see my sin \\
upon that cross ...
\end{song}
