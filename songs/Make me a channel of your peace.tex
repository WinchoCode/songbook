\songtitle{Make me a channel of your peace}
\begin{song}

Make me a channel of your peace \\
Where there is hatred let me bring your love \\
Where there is injury your pardon Lord \\
and where there's doubt the faith in you

\begin{chorus}
    Oh, Master, grant that I may never seek \\
    so much to be consoled as to console \\
    to be understood as to understand \\
    to be loved as to love with all my soul
\end{chorus}

Make me a channel of your peace \\
Where there's despair in life let me bring hope \\
Where there is darkness only light \\
and where there’s sadness ever joy

Make me a channel of your peace \\
It is in pardoning that we are pardonned \\
It is in giving to all men that we receive \\
and in dying that we are born to eternal life.
\end{song}
