\songtitle{Let the Heavens Declare}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    Let the heavens declare, let the mountains sing, \\
    Let the oceans roar that Jesus lives \\
    And is our King. \\
    Lift your hands in praise, let your spirits soar, \\
    Let the heavens declare, let the mountains sing, \\
    Let the oceans roar.
\end{chorus}

All the sins we’ve ever sinned \\
Died upon the cross with him, \\
But we know He lives again: \\
The victory is won.

Hanging on the cross for me \\
Jesus died in agony. \\
Blood and tears He shed for me, \\
That I might have life.

In the kingdom He revealed \\
Broken hearts can all be healed, \\
Through the covenant He sealed \\
With his holy blood.
\end{song}
