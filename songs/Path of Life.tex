\songtitle{Path of Life}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
Lord, You will show us the path of life, \\
show us the path of life. (x2)
\end{chorus}

Keep me, O God, \\
for in You I take refuge; \\
I say to You, \\
“My God are You.”

My heart is glad, \\
my soul rejoices. \\
You it is \\
who holds fast my lot.

I set the Lord \\
ever before me. \\
He’s at my right hand; \\
I shall not be disturbed.

Protect me, God, \\
for You are my refuge. \\
I praise You, God, \\
for You are my strength.

I bless You, God, \\
for You are my teacher. \\
Even at night \\
You guide my heart.

My heart is glad, \\
my body thrills with life. \\
My whole being \\
rests safe in You.
\end{song}
