\songtitle{Only in God}
\begin{song}

Only in God is my soul at rest, \\
In Him comes my salvation. \\
He only is my rock, \\
My strength and my salvation.

\begin{chorus}
My stronghold, my Savior, \\
I shall not be afraid at all. \\
My stronghold, my Savior, \\
I shall not be moved.
\end{chorus}

Only in God is found safety \\
When my enemy pursues me. \\
Only in God is found glory \\
When I am found meek and found lowly.

Only in God is my soul at rest, \\
In Him comes my salvation.
\end{song}
