\songtitle{Rejoice}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    Rejoice, rejoice in the Lord, our Saviour! \\
    Rejoice, rejoice in the Lord, our Saviour!
\end{chorus}

Let us never forget our God is very near. \\
And with the Lord we find our peace, \\
we have nothing to fear!

Why then worry at all. \\
Instead just pray to the Lord. \\
And with our pray'r then offer thanks, \\
trusting that He has heard.

Humble heart, now rejoice. \\
You've put your trust in the Lord. \\
For God's abundant with his grace, \\
love and mercy outpoured!
\end{song}
