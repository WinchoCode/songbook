\songtitle{I am the Bread of Life}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    I am the Bread of Life. \\
    All who eat this Bread will never die. \\
    I am God’s love revealed. \\
    I am broken that you might be healed.
\end{chorus}

All who eat of this heavenly Bread, \\
all who drink this cup of the covenant: \\
you will live forever, \\
for I will raise you up.

No one who comes to me shall hunger again. \\
No one who believes shall ever thirst. \\
All that the Father draws shall come to me, \\
and I shall give them rest.
\end{song}
