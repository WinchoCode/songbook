\songtitle{Unto the House of the Lord}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    I rejoiced when they said to me, \\
    "Let us go unto the house of the Lord," \\
    standing there, O Jerusalem, \\
    in your gates unto the house of the Lord.
\end{chorus}

Look upon Jerusalem, the city now restored. \\
Here the tribes of our God come as one unto the Lord.

As He ordered Israel, they come to praise his name, \\
here where courts of justice, the courts of David, reign.

Pray for peace Jerusalem, prosperity at home, \\
peace inside your city walls that comes from God alone.

Since we are God's people, I say, "Peace be to you!" \\
May the God who dwells in us your happiness renew.
\end{song}
