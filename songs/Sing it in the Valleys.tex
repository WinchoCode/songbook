\songtitle{Sing it in the Valleys}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    Sing it in the valleys, \\
    shout it from the mountain tops! \\
    Jesus came to save us, \\
    and his saving never stops! \\
    He is King of kings, and new life he brings. \\
    sing it in the valleys, \\
    shout it from the mountain tops! Oh! \\
    Shout it from the mountain tops!
\end{chorus}

Jesus, You are by my side, \\
You take all my fears, \\
If I only come to You, \\
You will heal the pain of years.

You have not deserted me, \\
though I go astray. \\
Jesus, take me in your arms, \\
help me walk with You today.
\end{song}
