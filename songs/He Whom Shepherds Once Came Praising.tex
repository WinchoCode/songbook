\songtitle{He Whom Shepherds Once Came Praising}
\begin{song}

He whom shepherd men came praising, \\
awed by heaven light a blazing, \\
cheered by angel news amazing: \\
King of glory Christ is born!

He whom sages, westward faring, \\
myrrh and gold and incense bearing. \\
Humbly worshiped, offerings sharing: \\
Judah's Lion reigns this morn!

Sing with Mary, maiden mother; \\
laud her Son, our newborn Brother; \\
angel ranks, lead one another, \\
hailing him in holy joy!
\end{song}
