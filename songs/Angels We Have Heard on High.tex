\songtitle{Angels We Have Heard on High}
\begin{song}

Angels we have heard on high \\
Sweetly singing o'er the plains, \\
and the mountains in reply \\
echoing their joyous strains.

\begin{chorus}
    Gloria, in excelsis Deo! 2x
\end{chorus}

Shepherds, why this jubilee? \\
Why your joyous strains prolong? \\
What the gladsome tidings be \\
which inspire your heavenly song?

Come to Bethlehem and see \\
Him whose birth the angels sing, \\
come, adore on bended knee, \\
Christ the Lord, the newborn King. 

See him in a manger laid, \\
hom the choirs of angels praise; \\
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid, \\
while our hearts in love we race
\end{song}
