\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia …
\end{chorus}

Jesus Christ is the Lord, alleluia, \\
Jesus Christ, truly risen from the tomb. \\
By his death He has conquered our death, \\
alleluia!

By his blood he has ransomed us all, \\
set us free from the darkness of our sin, \\
drawn us out from the power of night, \\
alleluia!

On this day we are called to proclaim: \\
Jesus’ love is triumphant over death, \\
by his cross he has won us new life, \\
alleluia!

Praise the Lord, for he comes to redeem. \\
To his pow’r and his glory let us sing. \\
Look to him, to the Lamb, that was slain, \\
alleluia!
