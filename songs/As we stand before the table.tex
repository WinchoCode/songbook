\songtitle{As we stand before the table}
\begin{song}

As we stand before the table \\
Where Christ offers Himself in our midst. \\
All we are we offer with Him \\
As He changes our being to His own.

In His infinite selfgiving \\
He himself bears the weight of our sins; \\
In exchange for such a burden He bestows \\
His Divinity on us.

Glory Father to the love which \\
sent your Son Jesus Christ to our world. \\
By the power of your Spirit, \\
Purify us to bring your life to all.
\end{song}
