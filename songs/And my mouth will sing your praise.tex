\songtitle{And my mouth will sing your praise}
\begin{song}

You Lord, alone, are the source of our life; \\
and my mouth will sing your praise forever. \\
You are our rampart, our fortress, our strength \\
and my mouth … \\
From You we draw all the joy of our hearts \\
and my mouth … \\
We place our trust in your most holy name \\
and my mouth …

\begin{chorus}
    Praise to You, o Lord, great is your name. \\
    Praise to You for all that You give. \\
    For your victory, glory to You, \\
    for your love poured into our hearts. \\
    And my mouth will sing your praise forever!
\end{chorus}

Lord, You have lifted the dark of our night, \\
and my mouth … \\
You are a guide and a lamp for our path, \\
and my mouth … \\
You give us strength for the battle to come, \\
and my mouth … \\
Lord, You alone are the source of our faith, \\
and my mouth …

You gather in all the lost and the strayed, \\
and my mouth … \\
All those whose hope lies in your love alone, \\
and my mouth … \\
They call to You in their anguish of heart, \\
and my mouth … \\
Lord you respond to the cry of their need, \\
and my mouth …

From those who hate me You rescue me, Lord, \\
and my mouth … \\
You give me victory over my foes, \\
and my mouth … \\
To all the nations I sing out your praise, \\
and my mouth … \\
I never cease to give thanks to your name, \\
and my mouth …
\end{song}
