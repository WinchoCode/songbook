\songtitle{Blessed Be Your Name}
\begin{song}

Blessed be your name \\
in the land that is plentiful \\
where your streams of abundance flow \\
Blessed be your name

Blessed be your name \\
when I'm found in the desert place \\
when I walk through the wilderness \\
Blessed be your name

\begin{chorus}
    Every blessing You pour out \\
    I'll turn back to praise \\
    When the darkness closes in \\
    Lord, still I will say

    Blessed be the name of the Lord \\
    Blessed be your name \\
    Blessed be the name of the Lord \\
    Blessed be your glorious name
\end{chorus}

Blessed be your name \\
when the sun's shining down on me \\
when the world's all as it should be \\
Blessed be your name

Blessed be your name \\
on the road marked with suffering \\
though there's pain in the offering \\
Blessed be your name

You give and take away \\
You give and take away \\
My heart will choose to say \\
Lord blessed be your name
\end{song}
