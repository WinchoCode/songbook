\songtitle{The old rugged cross}
\begin{song}

On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross \\
The emblem of suffering and shame; \\
How I love that old cross where the dearest and best, \\
for a world of lost sinners was slain.

\begin{chorus}
    So I‘ll cherish the old rugged cross \\
    till my trophies at last I lay down \\
    I will cling to the old rugged cross \\
    and exchange it some day for a crown
\end{chorus}

O that old rugged cross so despised by the world \\
has a wondrous attraction for me \\
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above \\
to bear it to dark Calvary

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true \\
It‘s shame and reproach gladly bear \\
Then He‘ll call me someday to my home far away \\
where His glory forever I‘ll share
\end{song}
