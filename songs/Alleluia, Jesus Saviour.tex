\songtitle{Alleluia, Jesus Saviour}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    Alleluia... 
\end{chorus}

Sing to the Lord, give your praise to Him. \\
He reigns in our hearts and offers us his life. \\
Open your eyes see his kingdom here, \\
Jesus God is with us.

He came to draw us into his light, \\
he opens his heart to freely give his love. \\
Christ is the Lord for eternity, \\
He has won us glory!

He sends us out into all the world, \\
to bring the good news and to proclaim his joy. \\
Let it resound through the universe: \\
God has saved his people!
\end{song}
