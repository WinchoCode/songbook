\songtitle{Worthy is the Lamb}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    Worthy is the Lamb that was slain \\
    to receive honor and glory. \\
    Worthy are the ones who believe \\
    to receive the goodness of God.
\end{chorus}

Worthy are you, O Paschal Lamb. \\
Wisdom and strength belong now to you. \\
You laid down your life and died upon the cross: \\
we’ve become a people of hope.

Worthy are you, O Bread of Life. \\
Salvation and joy belong now to us. \\
By conquering death and rising to new life, \\
we’ve become a people of praise.

Worthy are You, O Risen Christ. \\
Wonders and signs, revealing your might. \\
Your power and glory shine upon our lives: \\
we’ve become your light for the world.
\end{song}
