\songtitle{We Three Kings}
\begin{song}

We three kings of Orient are \\
Bearing gifts we traverse afar \\
Field and fountain, moor and mountain \\
following yonder star

\begin{chorus}
    O star of wonder, star of night \\
    Star with royal beauty bright \\
    Westward leading, still proceeding \\
    Guide us to thy perfect Light.
\end{chorus}

Born a king on Bethlehem's plain \\
Gold I bring to crown Him again \\
King forever ceasing never \\
over us all to reign

Frankincense to offer have I \\
Incense owns a Deity nigh \\
Prayer and praising voices raising \\
worship Him God most high

Myrrh is mine: its bitter perfume \\
Breaths a life of gathering gloom \\
Sorrowing, sighing bleeding dying \\
sealed in the stone-cold tomb

Glorious now behold Him arise \\
King and God and Sacrifice \\
Heaven sings “Alleluia! \\
“Alleluia!” the Earth replies
\end{song}
