\songtitle{Open the eyes of my heart, Lord}
\begin{song}

Open the eyes of my heart, Lord, \\
Open the eyes of my heart, \\
I want to see You, I want to see You. (repeat)

To see You high and lifted up, \\
shinin' in the light of your glory. \\
Pour out your power and love \\
as we sing holy, holy, holy!

Holy, holy, holy, \\
we cry holy, holy, holy, \\
You are holy, holy, holy, \\
I want to see You. (repeat)
\end{song}
