\songtitle{Turn to me}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    Turn to me, o turn and be saved, says the Lord, \\
    for I am God; \\
    there is no other, none beside me. \\
    I call your name.
\end{chorus}

I am God who comforts you; \\
who are you to be afraid \\
of flesh that fades, \\
is made like the grass of the field \\
soon to wither?

Listen to me, my people; \\
give ear to me, my nation: \\
a law will go forth from me, \\
and my justice for a light \\
to the people.

Lift up your eyes to the heavens, \\
and look at the earth down below. \\
The heavens will vanish like smoke, \\
and the earth will wear out \\
like a garment.
\end{song}
