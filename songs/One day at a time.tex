\songtitle{One day at a time}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    One day at a time, sweet Jesus, \\
    that's all I'm asking from You. \\
    Just give me the strength \\
    to do everyday what I have \\
    to do. Yesterday's gone sweet Jesus, \\
    and tomorrow may never be mine. \\
    Lord help me today, show me the way, \\
    one day at a time.
\end{chorus}

I'm only human, I'm just a woman. \\
Help me believe in what I could be \\
and all that I am. \\
Show me the stairway I have to climb, \\
Lord for my sake teach me to take \\
one day at a time.

Do You remember when you walked among men? \\
Well Jesus You know if You're looking below \\
it's worse now, than then. \\
Cheating and stealing, violence and crime. \\
So for my sake, teach me to take \\
one day at a time.
\end{song}
