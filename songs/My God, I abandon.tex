\songtitle{My God, I abandon}
\begin{song}

My God, I abandon my life into your hands, \\
do with me only what you will. \\
I'm ready for all, I accept all things, \\
do what you will, Lord, with my thanks!

\begin{chorus}
    For you are my Father, \\
    my life is in your hands. \\
    For you are my Father, \\
    I put my trust in You.
\end{chorus}

My God, I entrust everything I have to you,\\
in your hand I place my soul.\\
With all my heart I offer it to you, \\
I have one desire: Your will be done!
\end{song}
