\songtitle{Prayer for the city}
\begin{song}

We open our hearts \\
And our lives to You, O God. \\
Create within us a servant part \\
So that we can show your love.

Where all hope has been lost, \\
Let your Spirit bring new life. \\
To those in need bring prosperity. \\
Where there's darkness, shine your light!

\begin{chorus}
    We pray for the city we live in. \\
    We pray that our sins be forgiven. \\
    Do your will right here as in heaven. \\
    Father, we call on your Name.
\end{chorus}

We pray for our children. \\
We pray for our leaders. \\
We pray for our families. \\
Oh, bless us, Lord, we pray!
\end{song}
