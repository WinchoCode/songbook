\songtitle{Jerusalem, Our Heavenly Home}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    I saw the holy city come from God, \\
    bride of the lamb, and glory of the Lord, \\
    I saw the holy city come from God: \\
    Jerusalem, our heav’nly home.
\end{chorus}

The glory of the Lord shall give light, \\
no further need of sun or of moon. \\
The night is past and will be no more. \\
The Lamb will be the light that they need.

Behold God’s dwelling is in our midst, \\
He will wipe every tear from our eyes. \\
And death and mourning will be no more. \\
All former things have come to an end.

Salvation, pow’r, and glory to God! \\
The Lord our God, the Almighty reigns! \\
Let us rejoice, exult, and give praise! \\
This is the wedding feast of the Lamb!
\end{song}
