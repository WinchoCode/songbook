\songtitle{What a beautiful Name}
\begin{song}

You were the Word at the beginning, \\
one with God the Lord Most High, \\
Your hidden glory in creation, \\
Now revealed in You, our Christ.

\begin{chorus}
    What a powerful Name it is, \\
    what a powerful Name it is \\
    the Name of Jesus Christ, my King! \\
    What a powerful Name it is, \\
    nothing can stand against \\
    what a powerful Name it is \\
    the Name of Jesus!
\end{chorus}

You didn’t want heaven without us, \\
so Jesus, You brought heaven down. \\
My sin was great, Your love was greater, \\
what could separate us now?

What a wonderful Name it is …

Bridge: \\
Death could not hold You, \\
the veil tore before You, \\
You silence the boast of sin and grave! \\
The heavens are roaring \\
the praise of Your glory, \\
for You are raised to life again! \\
You have no rival, \\
You have no equal, \\
Now and forever God, You reign! \\
Yours is the kingdom, \\
Yours is the glory, \\
Yours is the Name above all names!

What a powerful Name it is …
\end{song}
