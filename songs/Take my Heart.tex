\songtitle{Take my Heart}
\begin{song}

Take my heart, O Lord, take my hope and dreams \\
Take my mind with all its plans and schemes

Give me nothing more than your love and grace: \\
These alone, O God are enough for me

Take my thoughts, O Lord, and my memory \\
Take my tears, my joy, my liberty

I surrender, Lord, all I have and hold \\
I return to you your gifts untold

When the darkness falls on my final days \\
take the very breath that sang your praise
\end{song}
