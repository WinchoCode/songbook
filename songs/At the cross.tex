\songtitle{At the cross}
\begin{song}

Oh Lord You've searched me, \\
you know my way. \\
Even when I fail you, I know You love me! \\
Your holy presence surrounded me, \\
in every season I know You love me, \\
I know You love me!

\begin{chorus}
    At the cross I bow my knees, \\
    where Your blood was shed for me, \\
    there's no greater love than this! \\
    You have overcome the grave, \\
    glory fills the highest place, \\
    what can separate me now!
\end{chorus}

You go before me; you shield my way. \\
Your hand upholds me \\
and I know You love me!

(Bridge) \\
You tore the veil, You made a way, \\
when You said that it is done. 2x

And when the earth fails, \\
falls from my eyes \\
and You stand before me, \\
I know You love me, \\
Oh, I know You love me
\end{song}
