\songtitle{The heart of worship}
\begin{song}

When the music fades, all is stripped away \\
and I simply come, longin' just to bring \\
something that's of worth, \\
that will bless Your heart. \\
I'll bring You more than a song, \\
for a song in itself \\
is not what You have required. \\
You search much deeper within \\
through the ways things appear. \\
You're looking into my heart!

\begin{chorus}
I'm comin' back to the heart of worship \\
and it's all about You, \\
It's all about You, Jesus. \\
I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it, \\
when it's all about You, \\
it's all about You, Jesus.
\end{chorus}

King of endless worth, no one could express, \\
how much You deserve? \\
Though I'm weak and poor, all I have, is Yours. \\
Every single breath! \\
I'll bring You more than a song, \\
for a song in itself \\
is not what You have required. \\
You search much deeper within \\
through the way things appear. \\
You're looking into my heart!
\end{song}
