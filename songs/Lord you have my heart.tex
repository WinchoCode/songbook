\songtitle{Lord you have my heart}
\begin{song}

Lord, you have my heart \\
and I will search for yours. \\
Jesus, take my life and lead me on.

Lord, you have my heart \\
and I will search for yours. \\
Let me be to you a sacrifice.

And I will praise you, Lord! \\
And I will sing of love come down, \\
and as you show your face, \\
we'll see your glory here.
\end{song}
