\songtitle{You shall be my people}
\begin{song}

I will take your hearts of stone \\
and give you hearts of flesh. \\
I will put my spirit within you.

\begin{chorus}
    You shall be my people, \\
    You shall be my people, \\
    You shall be my people, \\
    And I will be your God.
\end{chorus}

I will take clean water \\
and pour it over you. \\
From your sins will I purify you.

Through you will my holiness \\
and glory be revealed. \\
As I gather you from the nations.

I will take what was destroyed \\
and build it up again. \\
I will bring forth life in the wasteland.

I will breathe my life in you \\
and raise you from your graves. \\
Then you shall know I am the Lord God.

I will make a covenant \\
of lasting peace with you. \\
I will dwell forever among you.
\end{song}
