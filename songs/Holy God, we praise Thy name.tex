\songtitle{Holy God, we praise Thy name}
\begin{song}

Holy God, we praise Your name; \\
Lord of all, we bow before You; \\
all on earth Your scepter claim, \\
all in heav’n above adore You. \\
Infinite vens Your vast domain, \\
everlasting is Your reign.

Hark, the glad celestial hymn \\
angel choirs above are raising; \\
cherubim and seraphim \\
in unceasing chorus praising, \\
Fill the heav’ns with sweet accord: \\
“Holy, holy, holy Lord.”

All apostoles join the strain \\
as your sacred name they hallow; \\
prophets swell the glad refrain, \\
and the white-robed martyrs follow; \\
and from morn to set of sun, \\
through the church the song goes on.

Holy Father, Holy Son, \\
Holy Spirit, Three we name You; \\
while in essence only One, \\
undivided God we claim You, \\
then adoring bend the knee, \\
while we own the mystery.
\end{song}
