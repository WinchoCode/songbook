\songtitle{Hail Mary, full of grace}
\begin{song}

Hail Mary, full of grace, \\
the Lord is with you. \\
Blessed are you among women \\
and blessed is the fruit of \\
your womb, Jesus.

Holy Mary, mother of God, \\
pray for us sinners now \\
and at the hour of our death, Amen.

\begin{chorus}
    Gentle woman, quiet light, \\
    morning star so strong and bright, \\
    gentle mother, peaceful dove, \\
    teach us wisdom, teach us love.
\end{chorus}

You were chosen by the Father, \\
you were chosen for the Son, \\
you were chosen from all women, \\
and for women shining one.
\end{song}
