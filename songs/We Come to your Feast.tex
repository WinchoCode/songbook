\songtitle{We Come to your Feast}
\begin{song}

We place upon your table \\
a humble loaf of bread: \\
The gift of field and hillside, \\
the grain by which we’re fed. \\
We come to taste the presence \\
of Him on whom we feed, \\
to strengthen and connect us, \\
to challenge and correct us, \\
to love in word and deed.

\begin{chorus}
    We come to your feast, (x2) \\
    the young and the old, \\
    the frightened, the bold, \\
    the greatest and the least. \\
    We come to your feast, (x2) \\
    with the fruit of our lands, \\
    and the work of our hands, \\
    we come to your feast.
\end{chorus}

We place upon your table a simple cup of wine, \\
the fruit of human labor, the gift of sun and vine. \\
We come to taste the presence \\
of Him we claim as Lord, \\
His dying and his living, His leading and his giving, \\
His love in cup outpoured.
\end{song}
