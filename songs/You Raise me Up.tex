\songtitle{You Raise me Up}
\begin{song}

When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary, \\
When troubles come and my heart burdened be. \\
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence, \\
Until you come and sit awhile with me.

\begin{chorus}
    You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains. \\
    You raise me up to walk on stormy seas. \\
    I am strong, when I am on your shoulders. \\
    You raise me up to more than I can be!
\end{chorus}

There is no life – no life without its hunger, \\
Each restless heart beats so imperfectly. \\
But when you come and I am filled with wonder, \\
sometimes, I think I glimpse eternity.
\end{song}
