\songtitle{Psalm 21}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    My God, my God, \\
    oh why have you abandoned me?
\end{chorus}

All who see me scoff at me; \\
they mock me with parted lips, they wag their heads: \\
"He relied on the LORD; let him deliver him, \\
let him rescue him, if he loves him."

Indeed, many dogs surround me, \\
a pack of evildoers closes in upon me; \\
they have pierced my hands and my feet; \\
I can count all my bones.

They divide my garments among them, \\
and for my vesture they cast lots. \\
But you, O LORD, be not far from me; \\
O my help, hasten to aid me.

I will proclaim your name to my brethren; \\
in the midst of the assembly I will praise you: \\
"You who fear the LORD, praise him; \\
all you descendants of Jacob, give glory to him; \\
revere him, all you descendants of Israel!"
\end{song}
