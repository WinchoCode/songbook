\songtitle{Hymn to the cross}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
Praise to you, Lord! Glory to you! \\
For your cross is the root \\
of joy for the nations!
\end{chorus}

You come as our brother to save us from death. \\
(For your cross ...) \\
As wisdom eternat and image of God. \\
(For your cross ...)

A light to enlighten all people on earth. \\
(For your cross ...) \\ 
The glory of those God has called as his own. \\
(For your cross ...)

The Lamb who was slain for the sin of the world. \\
(For your cross ...) \\
For you make our peace by your blood on the cross. \\
(For your cross ...)

Our king and our shepherd, the humble of heart. \\
(For your cross ...) \\
You lead us to God by the way of the cross. \\
(For your cross ...) \\

(Bridge:)
Behold the cross of Christ, holy tree of life! \\
Behold the cross of Christ, bearer of our peace! (2x)

Glory to you, Lord, king of all the world! \\
Glory to you, Lord! You are prince of peace! (2x)

May the peace of Christ triumph in our hearts! \\
May the peace of Christ triumph in the world! (2x)

(Solo verses:)
You came down from heaven to save, \\
have mercy on us! \\
You hang on the wood of the cross, \\
have mercy on us! \\
You, who accepted death and died on the cross, \\
Jesus Christ, wellspring of our life!

You, who spent three days in the tomb, \\
have mercy on us! \\
You, who rose from out of the death, \\
have mercy on us! \\
You, who were lifted up to sit at God’s side, \\ 
Jesus Christ, wellspring of our life!
