\songtitle{I exalt You, God, my King}
\begin{song}

\begin{chorus}
    I exalt You, God, my King, \\
    I will bless your name ever more, \\
    my heart and my soul sing your praise, \\
    tell the world the glory of your name.
\end{chorus}

For the Lord is compassion and mercy, \\
slow to anger, abounding in love, \\
He showers his blessings upon us, \\
so great is his love for us all.

Praise the Lord, creation, praise the Lord, \\
may your people always bless your name, \\
praise the Lord, give glory to your reign, \\
may your wonders be praised here on earth.

He is truth in all of his ways, \\
He is love in all of his works, \\
He rescues those who fall, \\
and raises the humble of heart.

Let us praise the glory of the Lord, \\
may all people bless his holy name, \\
praise the Lord forever more, \\
alleluia, praised be his name.
\end{song}
