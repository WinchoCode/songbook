\songtitle{Through It All}
\begin{song}

You are forever in my life \\
You see me through the seasons \\
Cover me with Your hand \\
and lead me in Your righteousness \\
And I look to You \\
And I wait on You

\begin{chorus}
    I'll sing to You, Lord a hymn of love \\
    for Your faithfulness to me \\
    I'm carried in everlasting arms \\
    You'll never let me go through it all
\end{chorus}

Hallelujah, Hallelujah \\
Hallelujah, Hallelujah \\
Hallelujah, Hallelujah \\
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
\end{song}
