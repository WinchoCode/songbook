\songtitle{God of mercy and compassion}
\begin{song}

God of mercy and compassion \\
Look with pity upon me Father, \\
let me call Thee Father \\
'Tis Thy child returns to Thee

\begin{chorus}
    Jesus, Lord, I ask for mercy \\
    Let me not implore in vain \\
    All my sins I now detest them \\
    Never will I sin again
\end{chorus}

By my sins I have deserved \\
Death and endless misery \\
Hell with all its pains and torments \\
and for all eternity

By my sins I have abandoned \\
right and claim to heav'n above \\
Where the saints rejoice forever \\
in a boundless sea of love

See our Savior bleeding, \\
dying on the cross of Calvary \\
To that cross my sins have nail'd Him \\
Yet He bleeds and dies for me
\end{song}
